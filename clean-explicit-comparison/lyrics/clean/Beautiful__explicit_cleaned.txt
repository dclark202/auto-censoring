but need something pull out this dump

ended up this position
starting feel distant again
decided just pick this pen
up try make attempt
vent but just cant admit
or come grips fact that
may be done rap need new outlet

but just cant sit back wallow
own sorrow but know one fact
be one tough act follow

feel pain feel
inside each others minds
just see what find
look shit through each others eyes
but dont let say aint beautiful

dont let say aint beautiful
can all get fucked just stay true
think startin lose sense humor
