lately been hard reach
been too long own
everybody has private world where can be alone
are calling
are tryin get through
are reaching out
reaching out
just depressed
just cant seem get out this slump
if could just get over this hump
but need something pull out this dump
took bruises took lumps
fell down then got right back up
but need that spark get psyched back up
order pick mic back up
dont know how or why or when
ended up this position
starting feel distant again
decided just pick this pen
up try make attempt
vent but just cant admit
or come grips fact that
may be done rap need new outlet
know some sh hard swallow
but just cant sit back wallow
own sorrow but know one fact
be one tough act follow
one tough act follow
be one tough act follow
here today gone tomorrow
but have walk thousand miles
shoes just see
what like be
be lets trade shoes
just see what itd be like
feel pain feel
inside each others minds
just see what find
look sh through each others eyes
but dont let say aint beautiful
can all get f just stay true
dont let say aint beautiful
can all get f just stay true
think startin lose sense humor
everythings tense gloom
almost feel like gotta check temperature
room just as soon as
walk like all eyes
try avoid any eye contact
cause if that then opens door
conversation like want that
not lookin extra attention
just wanna be just like
blend rest room
maybe just point closest restroom
dont need f man servant
tryna follow around wipe
laugh every single joke crack
half aint even funny like
marshall funny man
should be comedian
unfortunately am
just hide behind tears clown
why dont all sit down
listen tale about tell
dont gotta trade shoes
aint gotta walk thousand miles
shoes just see
what like be
be lets trade shoes
just see what itd be like
feel pain feel
inside each others minds
just see what find
look sh through each others eyes
but dont let say aint beautiful
can all get f just stay true
dont let say aint beautiful
can all get f just stay true
lately been hard reach
