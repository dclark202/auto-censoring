never was thug just infatuated guns
never was gangsta til graduated one
got rep villain weapon concealin
took image thug kept shit appealin
willin stick out neck respect
if meant life or death never live regret what said
when people just wanna see if true
if youwhat say raps what
feel part obligation fulfill
when see streets face face are real
confrontation aint conversation if feel
violation any hesitationll get killed
if feel kill if conceal reveal
being reasonablell leave full bullets pull
squeeze til empty tempt push pussies
need good reason give this trigger good squeeze

love pissin off gets off
like lawyers when fuckin judge lets off
all motherfuckers gotta is set off
violate all motherfuckin bets be off
lit fuse anything bitch news
pistolwhippin motherfucking bouncers 62
who needs bullets as soon as pull sweat bullets
excellent method get rid next bully
actually better cause instead murderin
can hurt come back again kick dirt
like pourin salt wounds assault get sued
can smell lawsuits soon as waltz room
everybody halts stops calls cops
all see is bitches comin out halter tops
runnin duckin out hot rocks parking lot
all get shot whether fault or not cause

put curse authorities face adversity
