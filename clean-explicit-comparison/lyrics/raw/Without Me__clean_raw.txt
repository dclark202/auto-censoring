Obie Trice
Real name no gimmicks
Refrain 1 (Eminem):
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside
Refrain 2 (Eminem):
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back?
Verse 1:
I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
They want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of me mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Then a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey)
You waited this long to stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be or let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So come on, dip
Jump back, jiggle the hip and wiggle a bit
And get ready 'cause this is about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, "F- you, Debbie"

Chorus:
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said, this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
Verse 2:
Little hellions kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoner's helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the air waves, a rebel
So just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my, you ask for me
Well I'm back, nana-na nana-na kshh
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in up
Under your nails like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
"Testing attention please"
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

Chorus:
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said, this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
Verse 3:
A-tiskit a-taskit
I go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this and that
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty six year old bald headed skag
You don't know me, you're too old, let go, it's over
Nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes, man, it just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene (yeah)
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (hey)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me

Chorus:
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said, this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
