Whoa!
A get your hands in the air, and get to clappin 'em
And like, back and forth because ah
This is, what you thought it wasn't
It beez, the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G
And check out the man he goes by the name of er

Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M-eighty, you Little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherf***er you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, f*** it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet cause I'm comin' up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your a**
B****, I'm comin' out swingin', so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the f*** out like Mike Tyson
The Proof is in the puddin', just ask the Deshaun Holton
I'll slit your motherf***in throat worse than Ron Goldman

So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screamin' "F*** the world" like 2pac
I just don't give a f***!
Talkin' that s*** behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a f***!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my s*** is wack
I just don't give a f***!
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
Cause I just don't give a f***!

I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milk bone
I'm Everlasting, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up dis you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin'
Flavor with no seasonin', this is the sneak preview
I'll dis your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!)
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' s*** out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' your dead body inside of a f***in' trash can
With more holes than an Afghan

So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screamin' "F*** the world" like 2pac
I just don't give a f***!
Talkin' that s*** behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a f***!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my s*** is wack
I just don't give a f***!
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you fittin' to get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
Cause I just don't give a f***!

Somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)
I'm a caged demon, on stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
F*** droppin' the jewel, I'm flippin' the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherf***in' style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of b****es
Sick of naggin' bosses b****in' while I'm washin' dishes
In school I never said much, too busy havin' a headrush
Doin' too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in

So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screamin' "F*** the world" like 2pac
I just don't give a f***!
Talkin' that s*** behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a f***!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my s*** is wack
I just don't give a f***!
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you fittin' to get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
Cause I just don't give a f***!

Hey, f*** that!
