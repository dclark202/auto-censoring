I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier (La-de-dah-dah, dah-dah, dah-dah)
I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier
Yo

Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangsta 'til I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug, kept it appealin'
Willin'
Love ticking you off, gets me off Like my lawyers when the judge lets me off
All you gotta do is set me off
Violate, and all the bets be off I'm a lit fuse, anything do, it's news
Pistol-whipping bouncers 62"
Who needs bullets? As sOon as
Pull it, you swеat bullets
An excellеnt method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better 'cause instead of you murdering
You can hurt 'em and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pouring salt in the wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as waltz in the room
Everybody halt nd stops
