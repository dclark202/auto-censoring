 theres a lady whos sure all that glitters is gold and shes buying a stairway to heaven when she gets there she knows if the stores are all closed with a word she can get what she came for 
 ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh and shes buying a stairway to heaven theres a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure cause you know sometimes words have two meanings in a tree by the brook theres a songbird who sings sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven 
 ooh it makes me wonder ooh makes me wonder 
 theres a feeling i get when i look to the west and my spirit is crying for leaving in my thoughts i have seen rings of smoke through the trees and the voices of those who stand looking 
 ooh it makes me wonder ooh really makes me wonder 
 and its whispered that soon if we all call the tune then the piper will lead us to reason and a new day will dawn for those who stand long and the forests will echo with laughter 
 hu uh hu uh hu uh hu uh uoh oh hoh if theres a bustle in your hedgerow dont be alarmed now its just a spring clean for the may queen yes there are two paths you can go by but in the long run and theres still time to change the road youre on 
 and it makes me wonder ohhuhh your head is humming and it wont go in case you dont know the pipers calling you to join him dear lady can you hear the wind blow and did you know your stairway lies on the whispering wind 
 and as we wind on down the road our shadows taller than our soul there walks a lady we all know who shines while light and wants to show how everything still turns to gold and if you listen very hard the tune will come to you at last when all are one and one is all yea h to be a rock and not to roll and shes buying a stairway to heaven

 so i fell i need you to take myhand and keep my heartfrom ice 
 goldenfeet grace the surface of thesea sinking deeper i view them from underneath goldenfeet grace the surface of thesea 
 sinking deeper i view them from underneath flailing kicking as i head for the deep

 ive got a paper and pen i go to write a goodbye and thats when i know ive got a world of chances for you ive got a world of chances for you ive got a world of chances chances that youre burning through

 once there was a time when my mind lay on higher things and once there was a time i could find pretty words to sing but now well now i find it saves time to say what you mean i know it seems so unrefined but its time to let off some steam 
 oh come on 
 everybody knows that no means yes just like glasses come free on the nhs but the more i look through them the more i see im becoming more like alfie 
 once there was a time when a kind word could be enough and once there was a time i could blindfold myself with love but not now now im resigned to the kind of life id reserved for other guys less smart than i yknow the kind who will always end up with the girls 
 and besides everybody knows that no means yes just like glasses come free on the nhs but the more i look through them the more i see im becoming more like alfie im becoming more like alfie

 of the time when i tried to live life without you 
 birds falling down the rooftops out of the sky like raindrops no air no pride 
 if being myself is what i do wrong then i would rather not be right hopes turn into fear and with my one wing i cant fly with sunrise 
 embrace my dreams tight and thats why 
 birds falling down the rooftops out of the sky like raindrops no air no pride birds 
 to a place without fear with no moonlight all i need are trees and flowers and some sunlight where memories are being made and where the old one dies where love aint lies 
 birds falling down the rooftops out of the sky like raindrops 
 birds falling down the rooftops out of the sky like raindrops no air no pride thats why birds dont fly

 hello darkness my old friend ive come to talk with you again because a vision softly creeping left its seeds while i was sleeping and the vision that was planted in my brain still remains within the sound of silence 
 in restless dreams i walked alone narrow streets of cobblestone neath the halo of a street lamp i turned my collar to the cold and damp when my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light that split the night and touched the sound of silence 
 and in the naked light i saw ten thousand people maybe more people talking without speaking people hearing without listning people writing songs that voices never share and no one dared disturb the sound of silence 
 fools said i you do not know silence like a cancer grows hear my words that i might teach you take my arms that i might reach you but my words like silent raindrops fell and echoed in the wells of silence 
 and the people bowed and prayed to the neon god theyve made and the sign flashed out its warning in the words that it was forming and the sign said the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls and whispered in the sound of silence 
 hey mister curiosity is it true what theyve been saying about you are you killing me you took care of the cat already

 oh how do you do young willy mcbride do you mind if i sit here down by your graveside and rest for a while in the warm summer sun ive been walking all day and im nearly done and i see by your gravestone you were only nineteen when you joined the great falling in nineteensixteen well i hope you died quick and i hope you died clean or willy mcbride was it slow and obscene 
 did they beat the drums slowly did they play the fife lowly did they sound the death march as they lowered you down did the band play the last post and chorus did the pipes play the flowers of the forest 
 and did you leave a wife or a sweetheart behind in some loyal heart is your memry enshrined and though you died back in nineteensixteen to that loyal heart youre forever nineteen or are you a stranger without even a name forever enshrined behind some old glass pane in an old photograph torn tattered and stained and faded to yellow in a brown leather frame 
 did they beat the drums slowly did they play the fife lowly did they sound the death march as they lowered you down did the band play the last post and chorus did the pipes play the flowers of the forest 
 the sun shining down on these green fields of france the warm wind blows gently and the red poppies dance the trenches have vanished long under the plow 
 no gas no barbed wire no guns firing now 
 but here in this graveyard 
 thats still no mans land 
 the countless white crosses in mute witness stand to mans blind indifference to his fellow man and a whole generation 
 were butchered and damned 
 did they beat the drums slowly did they play the fife lowly did they sound the death march as they lowered you down did the band play the last post and chorus did the pipes play the flowers of the forest 
 and i cant help but wonder no willy mcbride do all those who lie here know why they died did you really believe them when they told you the cause did you really believe that this war would end wars well the suffering the sorrow the glory the shame the killing and dying it was all done in vain oh willy mcbride it all happened again 
 and again and again and again and again did they beat the drums slowly did they play the fife lowly did they sound the death march as they lowered you down did the band play the last post and chorus did the pipes play the flowers of the forest

 now i dont blame him cause he run and hid but the meanest thing that he ever did was before he left he went and named me sue 
 well he must of thought that it was quite a joke and it gotta lot of laughs from a lots of folks seems i had to fight my whole life through 
 some gal would giggle and id get red and some guyd laugh and id bust his head i tell ya life aint easy for a boy named sue 
 well i grew up quick and i grew up mean my fist got hard and my wits got keen roam from town to town to hide my shame 
 but i made me a vow to the moon and stars id search the honky tonks and bars and kill that man that give me that awful name 
 well it was gatlinburg in mid july and i just hit town and my throat was dry i thought id stop and have myself a brew 
 at an old saloon on a street of mud there at a table dealin stud sat the dirty mangy dog that named me sue 
 well i knew that snake was my own sweet dad from a worn out picture that my motherd had and i knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye 
 he was big and bent and gray and old and i looked at him and my blood ran cold and i said my name is sue how do you do now youre gonna die yeh thats what i told him 
 well i hit him hard right between the eyes and he went down but to my surprise he come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear 
 but i busted a chair right across his teeth and we crashed through the wall and into the street kicking and a gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer 
 i tell ya ive fought tougher men but i really cant remember when he kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile 
 i heard him laugh and then i heard him cuss and he went for his gun and i pulled mine first he stood there lookin at me and i saw him smile 
 and he said son this world is rough and if a mans gonna make it hes gotta be tough and i know i wouldnt be there to help ya along 
 so i give ya that name and i said goodbye i knew youd have to get tough or die and its that name that helped to make you strong 
 yeh he said now you just fought one hell of a fight and i know you hate me and you got the right to kill me now and i wouldnt blame you if you do 
 but ya ought to thank me before i die for the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye cause im the that named you sue yeh what could i do what could i do 
 i got all choked up and i threw down my gun called him my paw and he called me his son and i come away with a different point of view 
 and i think about him now and then every time i try and every time i win and if i ever have a son i think im gonna name him bill or george anything but sue i still hate that man

 mirror mirror on the wall true hope lies beyond the coast youre a damned kind cant you see that the winds will change mirror mirror on the wall true hope lies beyond the coast youre a damned kind cant you see that tomorrows bears insanity 
 gones the wisdom of a thousand years a world in fire and chains and fear leads me to a place so far deep down it lies my secret vision ill better keep 
 shall i leave my friends alone hidden in my twilight hall i know the world is lost in fire sure there is no way to turn it back to the old days of bliss and cheerful laughter were lost in barren lands caught in the running flames alone times geting short so follow me to find a path out of the dark 
 youre a damned kind cant you see that the winds will change mirror mirror on the wall true hope lies beyond the coast youre a damned kind cant you see that the winds will change 
 even though the storm calmed down the bitter end is just a matter of time 
 shall we dare the dragon merciless hes poisoning our hearts our hearts 
 times getting short so follow me to find a path out of the dark 
 youre a damned kind cant you see that the winds will change mirror mirror on the wall true hope lies beyond the coast youre a damned kind cant you see that the winds will change

 its a long its a long way back to the place where we used to sit when you and i were just little kids 
 the time we had is not gone the way we chose was the long one the time we had is not gone 
 the stone that fell is still falling so let that stone be the wondrous thing that comes to pass when the voices sing oh yeah 
 on the way on the way home i heard some ghost laughing in the trees moving inside the midnight breeze 
 the time we had is not gone the way we chose was the long one the time we had is not gone 
 way out here the voice and the mind are clear 
 the time we had is not gone the way we chose was the long one the time we had is not gone the time we had is not gone

 and we tumble down like jack and jill and i miss all of the joy you kill but i love you still be my thrill 
 be my one my day in the sun my little pop gun the best thing ive done be my what my open and shut my everything but my little hot slut 
 and we tumble down like jack and jill and i miss all of the joy you kill but i love you still be my thrill 
 every morning is like the one before and everybody needs someone to adore im counting on you oh oh baby say you will oh oh baby be my thrill 
 be my youth my kissing booth my little sweet tooth my beauty and truth be my thrill my little white pill my wait up until the one who will

 and we tumble down like jack and jill and i miss all of the joy you kill but i love you still be my thrill 
 yeah i love you still be my thrill 
 i walked through the door with you the air was cold but something bout it felt like home somehow and i left my scarf there at your sisters house and you still got it in your drawer even now 
 oh your sweet disposition and my wide eyed gaze were singing in the car getting lost upstate autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place and i can picture it after all these days 
 and i know its long gone and and magics not here no more and i might be okay but im not fine at all 
 cause there we are again on that little town street you almost ran the red cause you were looking over me wind in my hair i was there i remember it all too well 
 photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin size bed your mothers telling stories bout you on the tee ball team you tell me bout your past thinking your future was mean 
 i know its long gone and and theres nothing else i could do and i forget about you long enough to forget why i needed to 
 cause there we are again in the middle of the night we dance around the kitchen in the refrigerator light down the stairs i was there i remember it all too well 
 yeah well maybe we got lost in translation maybe i asked for too much but maybe this thing was a masterpiece till you tore it all up 
 running scared i was there i remember it all too well 
 and you call me up again just to break me like a promise so casually cruel in the name of being honest 
 im a crumpled up piece of paper lying here cause i remember it all all all too well 
 time wont fly its like im paralyzed by it id like to be my old self again but im still trying to find it 
 after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own now you mail back my things and i walk home alone 
 but you keep my old scarf from that very first week cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me you cant get rid of it cause you remember it all too well yeah 
 cause there we are again when i loved you so back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known it was rare i was there i remember it all too well 
 wind in my hair you were there you remember it all down the stairs you were there you remember it all it was rare i was there i remember it all too well 
 getting edgy all the time someone around me just a step behind its scary the shape im in walls are shaking and there closing in 
 too fast or bit too slow paranoid of people and its starting to show one habit i cant shake over my shoulder is a big mistake 
 sitting on the bed and lying wide awake demons in my head its more than i can take think im gonna roll but i think its kinda weak saying all i know is i gotta get away from me 
 tell you somethingjust aint right my head is on loose but my shoes are tight avoiding my firendsthey all bug life is like a riddle and im really stoned 
 theres a reason dont you know preoccupation is where youll go being followed look around its only my shadow creepin on the ground 
 sitting on the bed and lying wide awake demons in my head its more than i can take think im gonna roll but i think its kinda weak saying all i know is i gotta get away from me 
 i gotta get away from me i gotta get away from me 
 whoa whoa sitting on the bed and lying wide awake demons in my head its more than i can take think im gonna roll but i think its kinda weak saying all i know is i gotta get away from me 
 i gotta get away from me i gotta get away from me i gotta get away from me 
 your subtleties they strangle me i cant explain myself at all and all the wants and all the needs all i dont want to need at all 
 the walls start breathing my minds unweaving maybe its best you leave me alone a weight is lifted on this evening i give the final blow 
 when darkness turns to light it ends tonight it ends tonight 
 a falling star least i fall alone i cant explain what you cant explain youre finding things that you didnt know i look at you with such disdain 
 the walls start breathing my minds unweaving maybe its best you leave me alone a weight is lifted on this evening i give the final blow 
 when darkness turns to light it ends tonight it ends tonight just a little insight wont make this right its too late to fight it ends tonight it ends tonight 
 now im on my own side its better than being on your side its my fault when youre blind its better that i see it through your eyes 
 all these thoughts locked inside now youre the first to know 
 when darkness turns to light it ends tonight it ends tonight 
 just a little insight wont make this right its too late to fight it ends tonight it ends when darkness turns to light it ends tonight it ends tonight 
 just a little insight wont make this right its too late to fight it ends tonight it ends tonight tonight insight when darkness turns to light it ends tonight 
 its like forgetting the words to your favorite song you cant believe it you were always singing along it was so easy and the words so sweet you cant remember you try to feel the beat 
 eeteet eet eet eeteet eet eet you spent half of your life trying to fall behind youre using your headphones to drown out your mind it was so easy and the words so sweet you cant remember you try to move your feet 
 eet eet eet eet eet eet eet eet someones deciding whether or not to steal he opens the window just to feel the chill he hears that outside a small boy just starting to cry cause its his turn but his brother wont let him try

 one song glory one song before i go glory one song to leave behind 
 find one song one last refrain glory from the pretty boy front man who wasted opportunity 
 one song he had the world at his feet glory in the eyes of a young girl a young girl find glory beyond the cheap colored lights one song before the sun sets glory on another empty life time flies time dies glory one blaze of glory one blaze of glory 
 glory find glory in a song that rings true truth like a blazing fire an eternal flame 
 find one song a song about love glory from the soul of a young man a young man 
 find the one song before the virus takes hold glory like a sunset one song to redeem this empty life 
 time flies and then no need to endure anymore time dies

 stonecutters made them from stones chosen specially for you and i who will live inside the mountaineers gathered tender pilled high in which to take along driving many miles knowing theyd get here

 its empty in the valley of your heart the sun it rises slowly as you walk away from all the fears and all the faults youve left behind 
 the harvest left no food for you to eat you cannibal you meat eater you see but i have seen the same i know the shame in your defeat 
 but i will hold on hope and i wont let you choke on the noose around your neck and ill find strength in pain and i will change my ways ill know my name as its called again 
 cause i have other things to fill my time you take what is yours and ill take mine now let me at the truth which will refresh my broken mind 
 so tie me to a post and block my ears i can see widows and orphans through my tears i know my call despite my faults and despite my growing fears 
 but i will hold on hope and i wont let you choke on the noose around your neck and ill find strength in pain and iill change my ways ill know my name as its called again 
 so come out of your cave walking on your hands and see the world hanging upside down you can understand dependence when you know the makers land 
 so make your sirens call and sing all you want i will not hear what you have to say 
 cause i need freedom now and i need to know how to live my life as its meant to be 
 and i will hold on hope and i wont let you choke on the noose around your neck and ill find strength in pain and i will change my ways ill know my name as its called again

 a long long time ago i can still remember how that music used to make me smile and i knew if i had my chance that i could make those people dance and maybe theyd be happy for a while 
 but february made me shiver with evry paper id deliver bad news on the doorstep i couldnt take one more step 
 i cant remember if i cried when i read about his widowed bride something touched me deep inside the day the music died 
 so bye bye miss american pie drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry them good old boys were drinkin whiskey and rye singing this will be the day that i die 
 this will be the day that i die did you write the book of love and do you have faith in god above if the bible tells you so now do you believe in rock n roll can music save your mortal soul and can you teach me how to dance 
 re eal slo ow well i know that youre in love with him cause i saw you dancin in the gym you both kicked off your sho oes man i dig those rhythm and blu ues 
 i was a lonely teenage broncin buck with a pink carnation and a pickup truck but i knew i was out of luck the day the music died 
 i started singing bye bye miss american pie drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry them good old boys were drinkin whiskey and rye singing this will be the day that i die 
 this will be the day that i die now for ten years weve been on our own and moss grows fat on a rolling stone but thats not how it used to be when the jester sang for the king and queen 
 in a coat he borrowed from james dean and a voice that came from you and me oh and while the king was looking down the jester stole his thorny crown the cardroom was adjourned no verdict was returned 
 and while lennon read a book on marx the quartett practised in the park and we sang dirges in the da ark the day the music died 
 we were singing by ye bye miss american pie drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry them good old boys were drinkin whiskey and rye singing this will be the day that i die this will be the day that i die helter skelter in a summer swelter the byrds flew off with a fall out shelter 
 8 miles high and falling fa a a a a ast landed fou oul o on the grass the players tried for a forward pass with the jester on the sidelines in a ca a ast now the half time air was sweet perfume while sergeants played a marching tu une we all got up to da ance oh but we never got the cha ance 
 cause the players tried to take the field the marching band refused to yi ield do you recall what was revealed the day the music died 
 we started singing by ye bye miss american pie drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry them good old boys were drinkin whiskey and rye singing this will be the day that i die 
 this will be the day that i die oh and there we were all in one place a generation lost in space with no time left to start again so come on jack be nimble jack be quick jack flash sat on a candlestick cause fire is the devils only fri i iend 
 oh and as i watched him on the stage my hands were clinched in fists of rage no angel born in hell could break that satans spe ell 
 and as the flames climbed high into the night to l light the sacrificial rite i saw satan laughing with delight the day the music died 
 we were singing by ye bye miss american pie drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry them good old boys were drinkin whiskey and rye singing this will be the day that i die 
 this will be the day that i die i met a girl who sang the blues and i asked her for some happy news she just smi iled and turned away i went do own to the sacred store where id heard the music years before but the man there said the music wouldnt pla a a ay 
 in the streets the children screamed the lovers cried and the poets dreamed but not a word was spoken the churchbells all were bro oken 
 and the three men i admire most the father son and the holy ghost they caught the last train for the coast the day the music died 
 and they were singing bye bye miss american pie drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry them good old boys were drinkin whiskey and rye singing this will be the day that i die 
 this will be the day that i die they were singing bye bye miss american pie drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry them good old boys were drinkin whiskey and rye singing this will be the day that i die

 in good old times re member my friend moon was so bright and so close to us sometimes 
 we were still blind and deaf what a bliss painting the world of our own for our own eyes now 
 can we ever have what we had then friendship un breakable love means nothing to me without blinking an eye id fade if so needed all those moments with you if i had you beside me 
 one cloudy day we both lost the game we drifted so far and away 
 nothing is quite as cruel as a child sometimes we break the un breakable sometimes 
 and well never have what we had then friendship unbroken love means nothing to me without blinking an eye id fade if so needed all those moments with you if i had you beside me now 
 i was unable to cope with what you said sometimes we need to be cruel to be kind child that i was could not see the reason feelings i had were but sham and a lie 
 i have never forgotten your smile your eyes oh shamandalie 
 time went by many memories died im writing this down to ease my pain 
 you saw us always clearer than me how we were never meant to be love denied meant the friendship would die now i have seen the light these memories make me cry 
 can i ever have what i had then friendship unbroken love means nothing to me without blinking an eye id fade if so needed all those moments with you see the world with my wide open eyes 
 theres no other for me like the one of my childhood can you forgive me love got better off me on that day back in old times 
 i dont wanna talk about things weve gone through though its hurting me now its history 
 ive played all my cards and thats what youve done too nothing more to say no more ace to play 
 the winner takes it all the losers standing small beside the victory thats her destiny 
 i was in your arms thinking i belonged there i figured it made sense building me a fence 
 building me a home thinking id be strong there but i was a fool playing by the rules 
 the gods may throw a dice their minds as cold as ice and someone way down here loses someone dear 
 the winner takes it all the loser has to fall its simple and its plain why should i complain 
 but tell me does she kiss like i used to kiss you does it feel the same when she calls your name 
 somewhere deep inside you must know i miss you but what can i say rules must be obeyed 
 the judges will decide the likes of me abide spectators of the show always stay alone 
 the game is on again a lover or a friend a big thing or a small the winner takes it all 
 i dont wanna talk if it makes you feel sad and i understand youve come to shake my hand 
 i apologize if it makes you feel bad seeing me so tense no selfconfidence 
 but you see the winner takes it all the winner takes it all 
 so the winner takes it all and the loser has to fall 
 throw a dice cold as ice way down here someone dear 
 takes it all has to fall

 like a circle in a spiral like a wheel within a wheel never ending on beginning on an everspinning reel like a snowball down a mountain or a carnival balloon like a carousel thats turning running rings around the moon like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes on its face and the world is like an apple spinning silently in space like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind 
 like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone like a door that keeps revolving in a halfforgotten dream like the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes on its face and the world is like an apple spinning silently in space like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind 
 keys that jingle in your pocket words that jangle in your head why did summer go so quickly was it something that i said lovers walk along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand was the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand pictures hanging in a hallway or the fragment of a song halfremembered names and faces but to whom do they belong when you knew that it was over were you suddenly aware that the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair 
 like a circle in a spiral like a wheel within a wheel never ending or beginning on an everspinning reel as the images unwind like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind 
 pictures hanging in a hallway or the fragment of a song halfremembered names and faces but to whom do they belong when you knew that it was over were you suddenly aware that the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair 
 round like a circle in a spiral like a wheel within a wheel never ending on beginning on an everspinning reel as the images unwind like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind

 every rose has its thorn just like every night has its dawn just like every cowboy sings a sad sad song every rose has its thorn yeah 
 its been a long way but now we are near the midst of the fiery rain we know the thunder have summoned us all to the place were innocence got slain 
 behold the omens the river runs red the autumn winds carry the dead the final warning the very last command shattered remains for the damned 
 we wont surrender no never we will carry on 
 from the lake of fire they have come fierce almighty legions one by one when the flames of glory touch the sky trailblazers do or die 
 we are the mighty who soar through the air creating our own destiny warriors once and warriors to be forever our spirits fly free 
 we rode on lightning we shone like the sun in a thunderous symphony we fought them hard we fought them so brave sending them back to their grave 
 the hammer has fallen the fire still burns in our hearts 
 from the lake of fire they have come fierce almighty legions one by one when the flames of glory touch the sky trailblazers do or die 
 from the lake of fire they have come fierce almighty legions one by one when the flames of glory touch the sky trailblazers do or die 
 the visions we gazed upon as the nightmare returned on the uncaring slopes the mark of the shadows still burns 
 from the lake of fire they have come fierce almighty legions one by one when the flames of glory touch the sky trailblazers do or die 
 from the lake of fire they have come fierce almighty legions one by one when the flames of glory touch the sky trailblazers do or die

 we are just misguided ghosts traveling endlessly the ones we trusted the most 
 pushed us far away and theres no one road we should not be the same but im just a ghost and still they echo me they echo me in circles

 ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah come on hop on lets take a ride come and meet the travelers who came to town they have a tale from the past to tell from the great dark between the stars 
 we are a special speck of dust a fleeting moment on an ark a celebration a rest haven of life 
 lay on a field of green with mother eve with father pine reaching high look at yourself in the eyes of aye e aye unfolding rendezvous 
 deep into the past follow the aeon path greet a blade of grass every endless form most beautiful alive aware in awe before the grandeur of it all our floating pale blue ark of endless forms most beautiful 
 beyond aeons we take a ride welcoming the shrew that survived to see the tiktaalik take her first walk witness the birth of light

 i am driving up eighty five in the kind of morning that lasts all afternoon just stuck inside the gloom four more exits to my apartment but i am tempted to keep the car in drive and leave it all behind 
 cause i wonder sometimes about the outcome of a still verdictless life 
 am i living it right am i living it right am i living it right why why georgia why 
 i rent a room and i fill the spaces with wood in places to make it feel like home but all i feels alone it might be a quarter life crisis or just the stirring in my soul 
 either way i wonder sometimes about the outcome of a still verdictless life 
 am i living it right am i living it right am i living it right why why georgia why 
 so what so ive got a smile on but its hiding the quiet superstitions in my head dont believe me dont believe me when i say ive got it down 
 everybody is just a stranger but thats the danger in going my own way i guess its the price i have to pay still everything happens for a reason is no reason not to ask myself 
 if i am living it right am i living it right am i living it right why tell me why why why georgia why 
 he was born in the summer of his twenty seventh year comin home to a place hed never been before he left yesterday behind him you might say he was born again you might say he found a key for every door 
 when he first came to the mountains his life was far away on the road and hangin by a song but the strings already broken he doesnt really care it keeps changin fast and it dont last for long 
 but the colorado rocky mountain high ive seen it rainin fire in the sky the shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullabye rocky mountain high colorado rocky mountain high colorado 
 he climbed cathedral mountains he saw silver clouds below he saw everything as far as you can see and they say that he got crazy once he tried to touch the sun and he lost a friend but kept his memory 
 now he walks in quiet solitude the forest and the streams seeking grace in every step he takes his sight has turned inside himself to try understand the serenity of a clear blue mountain lake 
 and the colorado rocky mountain high ive seen it rainin fire in the sky talk to god listen to the casual reply rocky mountain high colorado rocky mountain high colorado 
 now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear of a simple thing he cannot comprehend why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more 
 more people more scars upon the land and the colorado rocky mountain high ive seen it rainin fire in the sky i know hed be a poorer man if he never saw an eagle fly rocky mountain high 
 colorado rocky mountain high ive seen it rainin fire in the sky friends around the campfire and everybodys high rocky mountain high colorado rocky mountain high colorado 
 rocky mountain high colorado rocky mountain high colorado rocky mountain high rocky mountain hi 
 blank face in the windowpane made clear in seconds of light disappears and returns again counting hours searching the night 
 might be waiting for someone might be there for us to see might be in need of talking might be staring directly at me 
 inside plays a lullaby slurred voice over children cries on the inside 
 haunting loneliness in the eye skin covering secret scars his hand is waving a goodbye theres no response or action returned 
 theres deep prejudice in me outshines all reasons inside given dreams all ridden with pain and projected unto the lost 
 oh so sexy yall

 it came out like a river once i let it out when i thought that i wouldnt know how held onto it forever just pushing it down felt so good to let go of it now not wrapping this in ribbons shouldnt have to give a reason why 
 its no surprise i wont be here tomorrow i cant believe that i stayed till today theres nothing here in this heart left to borrow theres nothing here in this soul left to say dont be surprised when we hate this tomorrow god knows we tried to find an easyer way yeah you and i will be a tough act to follow but i know in time well find this was no surprise 
 place we used to go the warm embrace that no one knows the loving look thats left your eyes thats why this comes as no as no surprise 
 if i could see the future and how this plays out i bet its better than where we are now but after going through this its easier to see the reason why 
 its no surprise i wont be here tomorrow i cant believe that i stayed till today yeah you and i will be a tough act to follow but i know in time well find this was no surprise 
 place we used to go the warm embrace that no one knows the loving look thats left your eyes but i know in time well find this was no surprise and i hoope and i hoope and i hoope and i hoope 
 this old heart of mine been broke a thousand times each time you break away i feel youre gone to stay lonely nights that come memories that go bringing you back again hurting me more and more 
 maybe its my mistake to show this love that i feel inside cause each day that passes by you got me never knowing if im coming or going cause 
 i love youuu yes i do this old heart i love youuu yes i do 
 this old heart weeps for you i try hard to hide my hurt inside this old heart of mine always keeps me crying the way you treat me leaves me incomplete you are here for the day gone for the week 
 but if you leave me a hundred times a hundred times i take you back im yours whenever you want me i wanna shout about it tell the world about it cause 
 i love youuu this old heart weeps for you i love youuu this old heart weeps for you 
 this old heart of mine been broke a thousand times each time you break away i feel youre gone to stay lonely nights that come momories that go bringing you back again hurting me more and more

 then broke a thousand times show this love oh yeah this old heart of mine this old heart of mine 
 when passions lostp and all the trust is gone way too far for way too long children crying cast out and neglected only in a world so cold only in a world this cold 
 hold the hand of your best friend look into their eyes then watch them drift away some might say weve done the wrong things for way too long for way too long 
 fever inside the storm so im turning away away from the name away from the stones cause im through mending the wounds of us 
 keep your thorns cause im running away away from the games away from the space the circumstances of a world so cold 
 burning whispers remind me of the days i was left alone in a world this cold guilty of the same things provoked by the cause ive left alone in a world so cold 
 fever inside the storm so im turning away away from the name away from the stones cause im through mending the wounds of us 
 keep your thorns cause im running away away from the games away from the space the circumstances of a world so cold 
 im flying im flying away why does everyone feel like my enemy dont want any part of depression or darkness ive had enough sick and tired bring the sun or i am gone 
 i need to find a darkened corner a lightless corner where its safer and calmer 
 im turning away away from the name away from the stones cause im through mending the wounds of us 
 im running away away from the games away from the space the circumstances of a world so cold 
 oh im flying im flying away away from the names away from the games the circumstances of a world so cold 
 youve been around for such a long time now or maybe i could leave you but i dont know how and why should i be lonely every night when i can be with you oh yes you make it right and i dont listen to the guys who say that youre bad for me and i should turn you away 
 cause they dont know about us and theyve never heard of love 
 i get a feeling when i look at you wherever you go now i wanna be there too they say were crazy but i just dont care and if they keep on talkin still they get nowhere so i dont mind if they dont understand when i look at you and you hold my hand 
 cause they dont know about us and theyve never heard of love 
 why should it matter to us if they dont approve we should just take our chances while weve got nothing to lose 
baby
 theres no need for living in the past now i found good loving gonna make it last i tell the others dont bother me cause when they look at you they dont see what i see no i dont listen to their wasted lines got my eyes wide open and i see the signs 
 cause they dont know about us and theyve never heard of love 
 no i dont listen to their wasted lines got my eyes wide open and i see the signs 
 cause they dont know about us and theyve never heard of love ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

 and so it was that later as the miller told his tail that her face at first just ghostly turn a whiter shade of pale 
 she said there is no reason and the truth is plain to see but i wandered through my playing cards would not let her be one of sixteen vestal virgins who were leaving for the coast and although my eyes were open they might have just as wellve been closed 
 and so it was that later as the miller told his tail that her face at first just ghostly turn a whiter shade of pale and so it was that late 
 all the things i felt and never shared all the times that she was lonely with me there the tears i wouldnt let fall from my eyes and how i let her go without a fight 
 the reasons im alone i know by heart but i dont wanna spend forever in the dark i swear next time ill hang on for dear life if love ever gives me another try 
 and theres no changin things that we regret the best that we can hope for is one more chance if the hands of time could just move in reverse i wouldnt make the same mistake again with her 
 the reasons im alone i know by heart but i dont wanna spend forever in the dark i swear next time ill hang on for dear life if love ever gives me another try

 theres a furnace set on high and a yearning undefined now its time to turn the tide its social suicide 
 shadows entertain the unwashed masses scholars explain their numb reactions i dont even know if i can ever find truth but im sure it wont come from following you 
 theres a furnace set on high and a yearning undefined but its time to turn the tide its social suicide

 oh we said when you are alone and afraid i will come to your aid was it just a dream just a dream cause it was real to me 
 we say these words again and again but they still sound the same we say these words again and again and again and again

 this is my life its not what it was before all these feelings ive shared 
 and these are my dreams that id never lived before somebody shake me cause i i must be sleeping 
 now that were here its so far away all the struggle we thought was in vain all in the mistakes one life contained they all finally start to go away 
 now that were here its so far away and i feel like i can face the day and i can forgive and im not ashamed to be the person that i am today 
 these are my words that ive never said before i think im doing okay 
 and this is the smile that ive never shown before somebody shake me cause i i must be sleeping

 now that were here its so far away and i feel like i can face the day i can forgive and im not ashamed to be the person that i am today 
 here we go the people show victims of tomorrow the way it goes it never shows emptiness or sorrow there is nothing left inside nothing left to cry for so i justify my crimes things that i must die for 
 so alone away it goes the life that you have wasted you never know where it might go sweet success youve tasted tasted by a bitter frown knowing i must die for cant confide to all the lies no one to inquire 
 well as i wander change of seasons as i realize that ill soon be there 
 ill let you know the reapers show makes you beg or borrow he comes to see the tragedy his fate he will not follow wearing your electric crown the preacher starts to pray shiver as the lights go down heed these words i say 
 well as i wander change of seasons i cant ponder got my reasons well as i realize i dont care all i know is that ill soon be there 
 now its done the time has come the people stand in silence another dawn has come and gone his fate has been decided well there is no one left inside a brain without a mind traces of a bitter man are all that you will find 
 well as i wander change of seasons well i cant ponder got my reasons well as i realize i dont care all i know is that ill soon be there and ill soon be there and ill soon be there and ill soon be there

 one two three four shapes made of four colored blocks like a t or a box come down like falling bricks 
 you can place them in rows but everybody knows that they made this game for chicks 
 mom just loves to flip and stack flip and stack grandma says this shit is like crack well it is this is the game girls deserve there is no learning curve which makes it great for noobs it will fill you with glee especially 
 if you have a vag and boobs your mom loves it mine does too mine does too 
 call me sexist bitch its still true just kidding about the bitch part 
 deep in a girls dainty brain theres a spot near a vein 
 which regulates their bliss once they see falling blocks the t spot unlocks and they start to sing like this 
 sing lalalalalalala we love tetris lalalala here is a trick i have learned to avoid getting burned when you piss of your chick 
 if you sing this on key immediately shell forget that youre a dick 
 lalalalalalala lalalalalalalala tetris helps when chicks want to neuter us if you love it you propably have a uterus so i was kinda trying to 
 communicate that i think women enjoy tetris a lot is that 
 i think i hear the sounds of then and people talking the scenes recalled by minute movement and songs they fall from the backing tape that certain texture that certain smell 
 to lie in sweat on familiar sheets in brick veneer onfinanced beds in a room of silent hardiflex that certain texture that certain smell brings home the heavy days brings home the night time swell 
 out on the patio wed sit and the humidity wed breathe wed watch the lightning crack over canefields and laugh and think this is australia 
 the block is awkward it faces west long diagonals and sloping too and in the distance through the heat haze in convoysof silence the cattle graze 
 that certain texture that certain beat brings forth the night time heat 
 check out out on the patio wed sit and the humidity wed breathe wed watch the lightning crack over canefields laugh and think that this is australia 
 to lie in sweat on familiar sheets in brick veneer onfinanced beds in a room of silent hardiflex that certain texture that certain smell brings forth the heavy days brings forth the night time swell 
 check out out on the patio wed sit and the humidity wed breathe wed watch the lightning crack over canefields and laugh and think this is australia

 tonight tonight tonight tonight i wanna be with you tonight tonight tonight tonight tonight i wanna be with you tonight 
 i wore a t shirt and my worn out hat abandoned as a summer cat and as i stood there as a broken hearted i realized you got the car keys still so i broke into my own old car i fell asleep on the passenger seat i dreamed of summer sex with you and you whispered in my ear 
 tonight tonight tonight tonight i wanna be with you tonight tonight tonight tonight tonight i wanna be with you tonight

 her green plastic watering can for a fake chinese rubber plant in the fake plastic earth that she bought from a rubber man in a town full of rubber plans to get rid of itself 
 it wears her out it wears her out it wears her out it wears her out 
 she lives with a broken man a cracked polystyrene man who just crumbles and burns he used to do the surgery for girls in the eighties but gravity always wins 
 it wears him out it wears him out it wears him out it wears 
 she looks like the real thing she tastes like the real thing my fake plastic love but i cant help the feeling i could blow through the ceiling if i just turn and run 
 it wears me out it wears me out it wears me out it wears me out 
 if i could be who you wanted if i could be who you wanted all the time all the time ah 
 two headed boy all floating in glass the sun it is past now its blacker than black i can hear as you tap on your jar and i am listening to hear where you are i am listening to hear where you are 
 two headed boy put on sunday shoes and dance round the room to accordion keys with the needle that sings in your heart catching signals that sound in the dark catching signals that sound in the dark 
 we will take off our clothes and theyll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine and when all is breaking everything that you could keep inside now your eyes aint moving now they just lay there in their climb 
 two headed boy with pulleys and weights creating a radio played just for two in the parlor with a moon across her face and through the music he sweetly displays silver speakers that sparkle all day made for his lover whos floating and choking with her hands across her face 
 and in the dark we will take off our clothes and theyll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine and when all is breaking everything that you could keep inside now your eyes aint moving now they just lay there in their climb 
 two headed boy theres no reason to grieve the world that you need is wrapped in gold silver sleeves left beneath christmas trees in the snow and i will take you and leave you alone watching spirals of white softly flow over your eyelids and all you did will wait until the point when you let go 
 in a little while from now if im not feeling any less sour i promise myself to treat myself and visit a nearby tower 
 and climbing to the top will throw myself off in an effort to make it clear to whoever what its like when youre shattered 
 left standing in the lurch at a church where people saying my god thats tough she stood him up no point in us remaining 
 we may as well go home as i did on my own alone again naturally 
 to think that only yesterday i was cheerful bright and gay looking forward to well who wouldnt do the role i was about to play 
 but as if to knock me down reality came around and without so much as a mere touch cut me into little pieces 
 leaving me to doubt talk about god in his mercy who if he really does exist why did he desert me 
 in my hour of need i truly am indeed alone again naturally 
 it seems to me that there are more hearts broken in the world that cant be mended left unattended what do we do what do we do 
 alone again naturally 
 looking back over the years whatever else that appears i remember i cried when my father died never wishing to hide the tears 
 and at sixtyfive years old my mother god rest her soul couldnt understand why the only man she had ever loved had been taken 
 leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken despite encouragement from me no words were ever spoken 
 when she passed away i cried and cried all day alone again naturally alone again naturally 
 sleeping through the evening singing dreams inside my head im heading out ive got some ins who say they care and they just might ill run away with you if things dont go as planned planning big could be a gamble ive already rolled the dice 
 i spit and stutter stuff and clutter worries in my worried corner maladjusted just untrusted rusted sometimes brilliant busted thoughts think ill stay for a while im intrigued and im red as a newborn white as a corpse

 i promise not to try not to fuck with your mind i promise not to mind if you go your way and i go mine i promise not to lie if im looking you straight in the eye i promise not to try not to let you down

 its not how fast you can go the force goes into the flow if you pick up the beat you can forget about the heat 
 its more than just survival more than just a flash more that just a dotted line more than just a dash 
 its a test of ultimate will the heartbreak climb uphill youve got to pick up the pace if you want to stay in the race 
 its more than blind ambition more than simple greed more than a finish line must feed this burning need 
 in the long run 
 from first to last the peak is never passed something always fires the light that gets in your eyes 
 one moments high and glory rolls on by like a streak of lightning that flashed fades in the summer sky your meters may overload you can rest at the side of the road if you can miss a stride but nobody gets a free ride 
 its more than high performance more than just a spark more than just the bottom line or a lucky shot in the dark 
 in the long run 
 from first to last the peak is never passed something always fires the light that gets in your eyes 
 one moment high and glory rolls on by like a streak of lightning that flashes fades in the summer sky you can do a lot in a lifetime if you dont burn out too fast you can make the most of the distance first you need endurance first youve got to last 
 from first to last the peak is never passed something always fires the light that gets in your eyes 
 one moments high and glory rolls on by like a streak of lightning that flashes fades in the summer sky 
 from first to last the peak is never passed something always fires the light that gets in your eyes 
 one moments high and glory rolls on by like a streak of lightning that flashes fades in the summer sky 
 what a hard and sultry summer steam just slides up off them streets you gotta stay inside and wait for the night and then come on over and see me 
 cause theres a poetry about these streets and it slips from your skin and goes right underneath and mama always knew id meet a girl like you but me i never believed cause ive been so lonely i cant imagine that kind of sympathy

 say it loud say it clear you can listen as well as you hear 
 its too late when we die to admit we dont see eye to eye so we open up a quarrel between the present the past we only sacrifice the future its the bitterness that last 
 so dont yield to the fortunes you sometimes see as fate it may have a new perspective on a different date and if you dont give up dont give in you may just be ok 
 say it loud say it clear you can listen as well as you hear 
 its too late when we die to admit we dont see eye to eye i wasnt there that morning when my father passed away i didnt get to tell him all the things i had to say 
 i think i caught his spirit later that same year im sure i heard his echo in my babys new born tears i just wish i could have told him in the living years

 we are two mariners our ships sole survivors in this belly of a whale 
 its ribs are ceiling beamsits guts are carpeting i guess we have some time to kill 
 you may not remember me i was a child of three and you a lad of eighteen 
 but i remember you and i will relate to you how our histories interweave at the time you were a rakeand a roustabout spending all your money on the whores and ho unds oh oh 
 you had a charming air all cheap and debonair my widowed mother found so sweet 
 and so she took you in her sheets still warm with him now filled with filth and foul disease 
 as time wore on you proved a debtridden drunken meess leaving my mother a poor consumptive wretch oh oh 
 and then you disappeared your gambeling arrears the only thing you left behiind 
 and then the magistrate reclaimed our small estate and my poor mother lost her miind 
 then one day in spring my dear sweet motherdied but before she did i took her hands as she dying criied oh oh find him bind him tie him to a pole and break his fingers to splinters drag him to a hole untill he wakes up naked clawing at the ceiling of his grave 
 it took me fifteen years to swallow all my tears among the urchins in the street 
 until a priory took pity and hired me to keep their vestry nice and neaat 
 but never once in the employ of these holy men did i ever once turn my mind from the thought ofrevenge oh oh 
 one night i overheard the prior exchangingwords with a penitent whaler from theseea 
 the captain of his ship who matched you toe to tip was known for wanton cruelty 
 the following day i shipped to sea with a privateer and in the whistle of the wind i could almost hear oh oh 
 find him bind him tie him to a pole and break his fingers to splinters drag him to a hole untill he wakes up naked clawing at the ceiling of his grave 
 there is one thing i must say to you as you sail across the sea always your mother will watch over you as you avenge this wicked deed 
 and then that fateful night we had you in our sight after twenty months atseea 
 your starboard flank abeam i was getting my muskets clean when came this rumbling from beneath 
 the ocean shook the sky went black and the captain quailed and before us grew the angry jaws of a giant whaale 
 dont know how i survived the crew all was chewed alive i must have slipped between his teeth 
 but oh what providence what divine in telligence that you should survive as well as me 
 it gives my heart great joy to see your eyes fill with fear so lean in close and i will whisper the last words words youll hear oh 
 in penny lane there is a barber showing photographs of evry head hes had the pleasure to know and all the people that come and go stop and say hello

 theres a palace a falling theres a smoke in the sky theres a boy running down into the lowlands tonight and hes catching a train to where hes heard you have been hes a fool now among us with dreamer within dreaming of you and on that day there was snowfall in the street yellow light and they quit billing rails 
 just by those dark shimmer eyes in that land theres a winter in that winters a day in that day theres a moment when it all goes your way and you know its a lions heart that will tumble and tear apart when hes coming down the hills for you 
 but can you still now remember whos been hiding up there through his howling at twilight all his songs of despair do you remember the caller of black and white crime well he lives by that memory and falls from his mind and you know its a lions heart that will tumble and tear apart when hes coming down the hills for you 
 well i walk in the city forever oooh walk in a time to be gone well theres no real goodbye if you mean it so i guess im forever alone 
 now hes a stranger among us he will die in the park where he hides from the statues and the weather remarks in that land theres a winter in that winters a day in that day theres a moment when it all goes away and you know its a lions heart that will tumble and tear apart when its coming down the hills for you 
 pure hearts stumble in my hands they crumble fragile and stripped to the core i cant hurt you anymore 
 loved by numbers you loosing lifes wonder touch like strangers detached i can feel you anymore 
 the sunshine trapped in our hearts it could rise again but im lost crushed cold and confused with no guiding light left inside 
 mh you were my guiding light 
 mh mh mhhhh epic motherfucking guitar solo oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh woh woh when com fort and warmth cant be found i still reach for you but im lost crushed cold and confused with no guiding light left inside youre my guiding light youre my guiding light 
 when theres no guiding light left inside when theres no guiding light in our lives

 you should have known the price of evil and it hurts to know that you belong here yeah ooh its your fucking nightmare 
 while your nightmare comes to life cant wake up in sweat cause it aint over yet still dancing with your demons victim of your own creation 
 beyond the will to fight where all thats wrong is right where hate dont need a reason loathing self assassination 
 youve been lied to just to rape you of your sight and now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel feel so sedated as they medicate your brain and while you slowly go insane they tell you given with the best intentions help you with your complications 
 you should have known the price of evil and it hurts to know that you belong here yeah no one to call everybody to fear your tragic fate is looking so clear yeah ooh its your fucking nightmare 
 ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha fight not to fail not to fall or youll end up like the others 
 die die again drenched in sin with no respect for another 
 oh down feel the fire feel the hate your pain is what we desire 
 lost hit the wall watch you crawl such a replaceable liar 
 and i know you hear their voices calling from above and i know they may seem real these signals of love but our lifes made up of choices some without appeal they took for granted your soul and its ours now to steal 
 as your nightmare comes to life you should have known the price of evil and it hurts to know that you belong here yeah no one to call everybody to fear your tragic fate is looking so clear yeah ooh its your fucking nightmare

 ive seen the sun comin up at the funeral at dawn the long broken arm of human law now it always seemed such a waste she always had a pretty face so i wonder how she hung around this place 
 heeey come on try a little nothing is forever theres got to be something better than in the middle but me and cinderella we put it all together we can drive it home with one headlight 
 she said its cold it feels like independence day and i cant break away from this parade but theres got to be an opening somewhere here in front of me through this maze of ugliness and greed 
 and ive seen the sun up ahead at the county line bridge sayin all theres good and nothingness is deadwell run until shes out of breath she ran until theres nothing left she hit the end its just her window ledge 
 heeey come on try a little nothing is forever theres got to be something better than in the middle but me and cinderella we put it all together we can drive it hoo oome with one headlight 
 well this place is old it feels just like a beat up truck i turn the engine but the engine doesnt turn well it smells of cheap wine and cigarretes this place is always such a mess sometimes i think id like to watch it burn 
 im so alone and i feel just like somebody else man i aint changed but i know i aint the same but somewhere here in between the city walls of dyin dreams i think her death it must be killing me 
 heeey come on try a little nothing is forever theres got to be something better than in the middle but me and cinderella we put it all together we can drive it home with one headlight 
 memories are just where you laid them drag the waters till the depths give up their dead what did you expect to find was there something you left behind dont you remember anything i said when i said

 searching my soul i find something else i take my life in my hands from the gates of heaven to the altars of hell the power is at my command 
 the lightning strikes cracking the night it feels like never before thunder and spark in the heart of the dark i feel a rising force uhhhh 
 burned by the glory of a sacred fire a rising force starts to shine alone in the inferno it soars ever higher leaving the demons behind 
 the lightning strikes cracking the night it feels like never before thunder and sparks in the heart of the dark i hear a rising force 
 the lightning strikes cracking the night im not the same any more thunder and spark in the heart of the dark i feel a rising force uhhhh 
 it has gotten to my head permeates the path i tread but i tread im moving on in a new and happy song i can sing about the night how my tunnel without light led me to the other side where the sky is blue 
 itsall i can doto not let them ruin me i will not let them ruin me i will not let them ruin me again 
 there is fire inside the tree flames of knowing kissing me i have waited long to see a sign from you 
 its all i can doto not let them ruin me i will not let them ruin me i will not let them ruin me again 
 i will not let them ruin me i will not let them ruin me i will not let them ruin me again 
 ruin me i will not let them ruin me i will not let them ruin me again 
 i will not let them ruin me i will not let them ruin me i will not let them ruin me again 
 the way she walks the way she talks how long can i pretend oh i cant help it im in love with the girl of my best friend 
 her lovely hair her skin so fair i could go on and never end oh i cant help it im in love with the girl of my best friend 
 i want to tell her how i love her so and hold her in my arms but then what if she got real mad and told him so i could never face either one again 
 the way they kiss their happiness will aching heart ever mend or will i always be in love with the girl of my best friend 
 and again the burden of losing rests upon my shoulders and its weight seems unbearable your tomb is where your heart is i should have told her but within me hid a secret so terrible 
 to cry is to know that youre alive but my river of tears has run dry i never wanted to fool you no but a cold heart is a dead heart and it feels like ive been buried alive by love 
 if i should die before i wake pray no one my soul to take and if i wake before i die rescue me with your smile 
 if i should die before i wake pray no one my soul to take and if i wake before i die rescue me with your smile 
 yeah the kiss of vanity blessed me with a spiritual murder fed the gods of war insatiable your home is where the dark is i should have told her embrace the fire indestructible 
 to die is to know that youre alive and my river of blood wont run dry i never wanted to lose you no but a cold heart is a dead heart and it feels like ive been buried alive by love 
 if i should die before i wake pray no one my soul to take and if i wake before i die rescue me with your smile 
 if i should die before i wake pray no one my soul to take and if i wake before i die rescue me with your smile 
 and they say to cry is to know that youre alive but my river of tears has run dry i never wanted to fool you no but a cold heart is a dead heart and a deserted soul is gone a cold heart is a dead heart and it feels like ive been buried alive by love 
 if i should die before i wake pray no one my soul to take if i wake before i die rescue me with your smile 
 if i should die before i wake pray no one my soul to take and if i wake before i die rescue me with your smile ive been buried alive by love ive been buried alive by love ive been buried alive by love ive been buried alive by love ive been buried alive by love ive been buried alive by love

 some days were ripped and torn away from the shores and tossed to a watery grave set adrift in the depths of the drink in the hands of the gods we curse 
 we call for help when no ones around shot down fleeting thoughts never make a sound set adrift in the depths of the dark in the heart of that sea where we wish 
 i feel it in my bones when the storm is close then await for the rain and the wind to blow as dark colors fill the sky im drenched that im feeling so alive eyes closed tight my ears open for the boat 
 we all carry the tune we love think of home when the waves and the going get tough hold our breath and go down with the wish of just one last kiss to rest 
 i feel it in my bones when the storm is close then await for the rain and the wind to blow as dark colors fill the sky im drenched im feeling so alive eyes closed tight my ears open for the boat eyes closed tight my ears open for the boat 
 oh oh oh

 from the air stadium lights stand out like flares and all i know is that youre sat here right next to me 
 we rarely see warning signs in the air we breathe right now i feel each and every fragment 
 this paper trail leads right back to you you say you need me to step outside 
 you spent the evening unpacking books from boxes you passed me up so as not to break a promise scattered polaroids and sprinkled words around your collar in the long run said you knew that this would happen 
 well this is something new but it turns out it was borrowed too why does every let down have to be so thin 
 rain explodes at the moment that the cab door closed i feel the weight upon your kiss ambiguous 
 you have to leave i appreciate that but i hate when conversation slips out of our grasp 
 you spent the evening unpacking books from boxes you passed me up so as not to break a promise scattered polaroids and sprinkled words around your collar in the long run said you knew that this would happen 
 two bodies in motion this is a matter of fact it wasnt built to last 
 two bodies in motion this is a matter of fact it wasnt built to last

 livin on the road my friend was gonna keep you free and clean and now you wear your skin like iron 
 and your breath as hard as kerosene werent your mommas only boy but her favorite one it seems she began to cry when you said goodbye sank into your dreams pancho was a bandit boy his horse was fast as polished steel he wore his gun outside his pants 
 for all the honest world to feel oh pancho met his match you know on the deserts down in mexico but nobody heard his dyin words ah but thats the way it goes 
 all the federales say they couldve had him any day they only let him slip away out of kindness i suppose 
 lefty he cant sing the blues all night long like he used to the dust that pancho bit down south ended up in leftys mouth the day they laid poor pancho low 
 lefty split for ohio where he got the bread to go there aint nobody knows all the federales say they couldve had him any day we only let him slip away out of kindness i suppose 
 the poets tell how pancho fell and leftys livin in a cheap hotel the deserts quiet clevelands cold and so the story ends were told pancho needs your prayers its true but save a few for lefty too he only did what he had to do and now hes growing old 
 and all the federales say they couldve had him any day we only let him go so long out of kindness i suppose 
 a few grey federales say they couldve had him any day we only let him go so long out of kindness i suppose 
 love is what theyll get when they break up and join in spleen united love is what theyll get when they break up and join in spleen united 
 what are we doing here when all we wants out there 
 what are we doing here when all we wants out there 
 love is what theyll get when they break up and join in spleen united love is what theyll get when they break up and join in spleen united 
 i turn my back to the wind to catch my breath before i start off again driven on without a moment to spend to pass an evening with drink and a friend 
 i let my skin get too thin id like to pause no matter what i pretend like some pilgrim who learns to transcend learns to live as if each step was the end 
 im not looking back but i want to look around me now see more of the people and the places that surround me now time stand still 
 freeze this moment a little bit longer make each sensation a little bit stronger 
 experience slips away experience slips away time stands still 
 i turn my face to the sun i close my eyes let my defences down all those wounds that i cant get unwound 
 i let my past go too fast no time to pause if i could slow it all down like some captain whose ship runs aground i can wait until the tide comes around 
 im not looking back but i want to look around me now see more of the people and the places that surround me now 
 freeze this moment a little bit longer make each sensation a little bit stronger make each impression a little bit stronger freeze this motion a little bit longer 
 the innocence slips away the innocence slips away time stand still time stand still 
 im not looking back but i want to look around me now see more of the people and the places that surround me now time stand still 
 summers going fast nights growing colder children growing up old friends growing older freeze this moment a little bit longer make each sensation a little bit stronger 
 experience slips away experience slips away the innocence slips away 
 a child in sweet duplicity for innocence or slavery to nature and the bents that haunt him 
 straight out of the womb he doesnt have to learn the things unseemly that his instinct brings to carry like a burden from the cradle to the tomb youll never have to teach him how to lie if we are born in innocence well dont you wonder why for selfishness already dwells inside the birthright of adam the curse of the old man 
 day and night jekyll and hyde in the fairytale this is much more frightning darkness and light feed the new man and tear the veil see the old man dying 
 behold the loving family man who tries to do the best he can and loves his wife and children even more than his own life but just like that a wandering eye leads to a suffoccating lie 
 and selfishness and deep betrayal cuts them like a knife if mankind doesnt have a sinful drive then tell me why hed wreck his life to get some on the side the warring of two natures deep inside starving the new keeps the old man alive 
 day and night jekyll and hyde in the fairytale this is much more frightning darkness and light feed the new man and tear the veil see the old man dying 
 soul sickness nailed to a cross 
 intrumental day and night jekyll and hyde in the fairytale this is much more frightning darkness and light feed the new man and tear the veil see the old man dying 
 day and night jekyll and hyde in the fairytale this is much more frightning darkness and light feed the new man and tear the veil see the old man dying 
 humankind in innocence a lie so thinly veiled man born without soul sickness this is the fairytale whoahhoahoahoah hide in the fairytale tale whoah hide in the fairytale see the old man dying 
 you know a dream is like a river ever changin as it flows 
 and a dreamers just a vessel that must follow where it goes trying to learn from whats behind you and never knowing whats in store makes each day a constant battle just to stay between the shores 
 and i will sail my vessel til the river runs dry like a bird upon the wind these waters are my sky ill never reach my destination if i never try so i will sail my vessel til the river runs dry 
 too many times we stand aside and let the waters slip away til what we put off til tomorrow has now become today so dont you sit upon the shoreline and say youre satisfied choose to chance the rapids and dare to dance the tide 
 yes i will sail my vessel til the river runs dry like a bird upon the wind these waters are my sky ill never reach my destination if i never try so i will sail my vessel til the river runs dry 
 and theres bound to be rough waters and i know ill take some falls but with the good lord as my captain i can make it through them all 
 yes i will sail my vessel til the river runs dry like a bird upon the wind these waters are my sky ill never reach my destination if i never try so i will sail my vessel til the river runs dry 
 yes i will sail my vessel til the river runs dry til the river runs dry 
 this song sounds dramatic but im bad at writing words if you dont speak english this probly sounds pretty good 
 youd prob ly think im singing bout some pretty serious stuff but in reality im singing bout the lack of stuff im singing bout 
 this parts intense and emotional as long as you dont understand it youre foreign grandma would love this song please send it to her and shell probly tell her 
 foreign friends about the song her grandson or daughter sent her to day this song might hit the charts in her country if parts sounded like coldplay 
 if the chorus sounds like coldplay then ill put some la la las in there la la la la la la la la la la la la 
 hopefully your foreign grandma listens to this song every day and if she asks you to translate the lyrics heres what you say 
 a perfect translation does not exist well at least not in your language but if you must know well picture this 
 fifty billion rainbows and the sun is setting and the moon is setting also and youre there in a gazebo and then god descends from heaven and he gives you a million dollars 
 take that feeling and put it into a song i could translate word by word but thatd take too long and ive got stuff to do grandma

 they must have loved each other once but that was many years ago and by the time i came along things were already going wrong i felt the pain in their pretense the side they tried hard not to show but through the simple eyes of youth it wasnt hard to see the truth 
 and in the end nobody wins when love begins to fall apart and its the innocent who pay when broken dreams get in the way the game begins the game nobody wins 
 they must have loved each other once before the magic slipped away and as their life became a lie what love remained began to die i used to hide beneath the sheets i prayed that time would find a way but with the passing of the years i watched as laughter turned to tears 
 and in the end nobody wins when love begins to fall apart and its the innocent who pay when broken dreams get in the way the game begins the game nobody wins 
 we used to love each other once with all the passion we possessed but people change as time goes by some feelings grow while others die but if we learn from what we see and face the truth while we still can then though the passion may be gone some kind of love can still live on 
 and in the end nobody wins when love begins to fall apart and its the innocent who pay when broken dreams get in the way the game begins the game nobody wins 
 nobody wins nobody wins la la la la la la la la and its the innocent who pay when broken dreams get in the way the game begins the game nobody wins nobody wins nobody wins nobody wins nobody wi

 fever is burning in his veins determined with courage breaking the chain back against the wall under blood red skies prepared to fight until he dies and his eyes are blazing with fire longing for the deepest desire 
 heart of an eagle he flies through the rainbow into a new world and finds the sun spreading his wings above all the sorrows the glory of eagleheart

 a triangle trying to squeeze through a circle he tried to cut me so id fit 
 and doesnt that sound familiar doesnt that hit too close to home doesnt that make you shiver the way things couldve gone and doesnt it feel peculiar when everyone wants a little more so that i do remember to never go that far 
 could you leave me with a scar so the next one came with a bag of treats she smelled like sugar and spoke like the sea and she told me dont trust them trust me then she pulled at my stitches one by one looked at my insides clicking her tongue and said this will all have to come undone 
 a triangle trying to squeeze through a circle she tried to cut me so id fit 
 doesnt that soundfamiliar doesnt that hit too close to home doesnt that make you shiver the way things couldve gone and doesnt it feel peculiar when everyone wants a little more so that i do remember to never go that far could you leave me with a scar think i realised just in time although my old self was hard to find you can bathe me in your finest wine

 here i am the future is mine our dreams can become reality im in charge of lifes great circle i control my path of wealth 
 ambitions high burning the flames burn deep down in our souls to be known for efficiency and passion 
 seperate goals but fire shared oh i can think i can work i dont need your support our love is pale but its not in my way to share our lives our fire 
 ambitions high burning the flames burn deep down in our souls to be known for efficiency and passion ambitions 
 dreams theyre burning the flames burn deeper towards our goals our needs 
 suddenly we have been careless a new life a new dimension it disturbs our solid future it puts out the fire we both need its a choice between the passion or the love that can be saved now see the child here as a saviour choose for love and let this life begin 
 feel it this life in me moving with this child we must make choices it can save us if we want oh i fear it the path we take is this a choice anyway between love and fire 
 ambitions high burning the flames burn deep down in our souls to be known for efficiency and passion ambitions 
 dreams theyre burning the flames burn deeper towards our goals our needs 
 in matching blue raincoats our shoes where our snowboats we kicked around from stairway to station we made a sensation with the gadabout crowd and oh what a bargain were two easy targets for the old men at the off tracks whove paid in palaver and crumpled old dollars which we squirreled away in our rat trap hotel by the freeway and we slept in sundays your parents were anxious your cool was contagious at the old school you left without leaving a note for your grieving sweet mother while 
 your brother was so cruel and here in the alleys your spirits were rallied as you learned quick to make a fast buck in bathrooms and barrooms on dumpsters and heirlooms we bit our tongues sucked our lips into our lungs til we were falling such was our calling 
 and here in our hollow we fuse like a family but i will not morn for you so take up your makeup and pocket your pills away were kings among run aways on the bus mall were down on the bus mall 
 among all the urchins and old chinese merchants of the old town we reigned at the pool hall with one iron cue ball and we never let the bastards get us down and we laughed off the quick tricks the old men with limp dicks on the colonnades of the waterfront park as four in the morning came on cold and boring we huddled close in the bus stop enclosure enfolding our hands tightly holding 
 but here in our hollow we fuse like a family but i will not morn for you so take up your makeup and pocket your pills away were kings among run aways on the bus mall were down on the bus mall were down on the bus mall down on the bus mall oh ooh oh

 to prove that i exist if i only could tell you if you only would listen ive got a line or two to use on you ive got a romance we could christen 
 theres a word in spanish i dont understand but i heard it in a film one time spoken by the leading man he said it with devotion sounded so sincere and the words he spoke in spanish brought the female lead to tears a word in spanish

 seems like theres a hole in my dreams in my dreams in my dreams

 did your bed and bookshelf go and run run run away these four walls saw the rise and fall of the midnight getaway 
 seems like theres a hole in my dreams or so it seems yet nothing means anything anymore 
 anytime i need to see your face i just close my eyes and i am taken to a place where your crystal mind and magenta feelings take up shelter in the base of my spine sweet like a chica cherry cola 
 i dont need to try and explain i just hold on tight and if it happens again i might move so slightly to the arms and the lips and the face of the human cannonball that i need to i want to ah 
 well come stand a little bit closer breathe in and get a bit higher youll never know what hit you when i get to you 
 ooh i want you i dont know if i need you but ooh id die to find out ooh i want you i dont know if i need you but ooh i would die to find out 
 im the kind of person who endorses a deep commitment getting comfy getting perfect is what i live for but a look and then a smell of perfume its like im down on the floor and i dont know what im in for 
 conversation has a time and place in the interaction of a lover and a mate but the time of talking using symbols using words can be likened to a deep sea diver who is swimming with a raincoat 
 well come stand a little bit closer breathe in and get a bit higher youll never know what hit you when i get to you 
 ooh i want you i dont know if i need you but ooh id die to find out ooh i want you i dont know if i need you but ooh i would die to find out

 when the last eagle flies over the last crumbling mountain and the last lion roars at the last dusty fountain in the shadow of the forest though she may be old and worn they will stare unbelieving at the last unicorn 
 when the first breath of winter through the flowers is icing and you look to the north and a pale moon is rising and it seems like all is dying and would leave the world to mourn in the distance hear the laughter of the last unicorn 
 im alive im alive 
 when the last moon is cast over the last star of morning and the future has passed without even a last desperate warning then look into the sky where through the clouds a path is formed look and see her how she sparkles its the last unicorn 
 im alive im alive

 i broke the mirror to the past to find what i was looking for the bleeding heart of broken glass is all i found and nothing more regrets short of no correction paid my debts to anxiety the iron lung collapsed from the pressure and the swelling i can hardly breathe at all

 the wind blows hard against this mountainside across the sea into my soul it reaches into where i cannot hide setting my feet upon the road 
 my heart is old it holds my memories my body burns a gemlike flame somewhere between the soul and soft machine is where i find myself again 
 kyrie eleison down the road that i must travel kyrie eleison through the darkness of the night 
 kyrie eleison where im going will you follow kyrie eleison on a highway in the light 
 whoa when i was young i thought of growing old of what my life would mean to me would i have followed down my chosen road or only wished what i could be

 kyrie eleison where im going will you follow kyrie eleison on a highway in the light 
 whoa whoa whoa whoa kyrie eleison down the road that i must travel kyrie eleison through the darkness of the night

 and it came to me then that every plan is a tiny prayer to father time as i stared at my shoes in the icu that reeked of piss and 409 and i rationed my breaths as i said to myself that id already taken too much today as each descending peak on the lcd took you a little farther away from me away from me 
 amongst the vending machines and yearold magazines in a place where we only say goodbye it stung like a violent wind that our memories depend on a faulty camera in our minds 
 but i knew that you were a truth i would rather lose than to have never lain beside at all and i looked around at allthe eyes on the ground as the tv entertained itself cause theres no comfort in the waiting roomjust nervous pacers bracing for bad newsand then the nurse comes round and everyone will lift their heads but imthinking of what sarah said 
 that love is watching someone die 
 so whos gonna watch you die 
 so whos gonna watch you die so whos gonna watch you die 
 what a thrill with darkness and silence through the night what a thrill im searching and im melt into you what a fear in my heart but youre so supreme 
 i give my life not for honor but for you in my time therell be no one else crime its the way i fly to you im still in a dream snake eater 
 someday you go through the rain and someday you feed on a tree frog its ordeal the trial to survive for the day we see new light 
 i give my life not for honor but for you in my time therell be no one else crime its the way i fly to you im still in a dream snake eater im still in a dream snake eater

 on a morning from a bogart movie in a country where they turn back time you go strolling through the crowd like peter lorre contemplating a crime she comes out of the sunin a silk dress running like a watercolor in the rain dont bother asking for explanations shell just tell you that she came in the year of the cat 
 she doesnt give you time for questions as shes lockin up your arm in hers and you follow till your senseof which direction completely disappears by the blue tiled walls near the market stalls theres a hidden door she leads you to these days she says i feel my life just like a river running through the year of the cat 
 well she looks at you so cooly and her eyes shine like the moon in the sea she comes in incense and patchouli so you take her to find whats waiting inside the year of the cat 
 well morning comes and youre still with her and the bus and the tourists are gone and youve thrown the way your choice and lost your ticket so you have to stay on but the drumbeat strains of the night remain in the rhythm of the newborn day you know sometime youre bound to leave her but for now youre going to stay in the year of the cat 
 high way run in to the midnight sun wheels go round and round youre on my mind restless hearts sleep alone tonght sending all my love along the wire

 i woke up in a dream today to the cold of the static and put my cold feet on the floor forgot all about yesterday remembering im pretending to be where im not anymore a little taste of hypocrisy and im left in the wake of the mistake slow to react even though youre so close to me youre still so distant and i cant bring you back 
 its true the way i feel was promised by your face the sound of your voice painted on my memories even if youre not with me im with you 
 you now i see keeping everything inside with you you now i see even when i close my eyes 
 i hit you and you hit me back we fall to the floor the rest of the day stands still fine line between this and that when things go wrong i pretend the past isnt real im trapped in this memory and im left in the wake of the mistake slow to react so even though youre close to me youre still so distant and i cant bring you back 
 its true the way i feel was promised by your face the sound of your voice painted on my memories even if youre not with me im with you 
 you now i see keeping everything inside with you you now i see even when i close my eyes 
 with you you now i see keeping everything inside with you you now i see even when i close my eyes 
 no no matter how far weve come i cant wait to see tomorrow no matter how far weve come i i cant wait to see tomorrow with you 
 you now i see keeping everything inside with you you now i see even when i close my eyes 
 with you you now i see keeping everything inside with you you now i see even when i close my eyes 
 your bodys warm but you are not you give a little not a lot you coup your love until we kiss youre all i want but not like this 
 im watching you dissappear but you you will never here 
 its only your shadow never yourself its only your shadow nobody else its only your shadow filling the room arriving too late living too soon living too soon 
 your body gives but then holds back the sun is bright the sky is black i can only be another sign i cannot keep what isnt mine

 believing my perceptions were oh so real but i didnt know nothing still knowing nothing was just enough for me to know the way i feel this is life what a fucked up thing we do what a nightmare come true or a playground if we choose and i choose 
 look at me im swollen like a banana fish now im never gonna make it make it out of my hole but i keep on laughing doesnt really matter theres dozens of reasons for explaining my soul when i was a teenager suckin booze with the vatos discussing who was gonna live to be twenty one 
 they said they wouldnt make it they didnt make it were all naked when the day is said and done this is life what a fucked up thing we do what a nightmare come true or a playground if we choose and i choose 
 dont know who made this all come true now while youre here you just gotta do what you gotta do one two three four now if i wasnt such a weenie do you think youd still love me 
 pretending im an airplane on the living room floor like a lovely generator you stand right by me and if words were wisdom id be talking even more so i keep on falling as im looking back above me watching as my mama just becomes a little dot 
 now im im like deniro im amarillo and ill never know when i hit the ground this is life what a fucked up thing we do what a nightmare come true or a playground if we choose yeah choose yeah choose and i choose 
 in the shadow of the moon she danced in the starlight whispering a haunting tune to the night 
 velvet skirts spun round and round fire in her stare in the woods without a sound no one cared 
 through the darkened fields entranced music made her poor heart dance thinking of a lost romance long ago 
 oh feeling lonely feeling sad she cried in the moonlight driven by a world gone mad she took flight 
 feel no sorrow feel no pain feel no hurt theres nothing gained only love will then remain she would say 
 shadow of the moon shadow of the moon shadow of the moon shadow of the moon 
 through the darkened fields entranced music made her poor heart dance thinking of a lost romance long a go 
 oh somewhere just beyond the mist spirits were seen flying as the lightning led her way through the dark 
 in the shadow of the moon she danced in the starlight whispering a haunting tune to the night 
 shadow of the moon shadow of the moon shadow of the moon shadow of the moon 
 shadow of the moon shadow of the moon shadow of the moon shadow of the moon 
 shadow of the moon shadow of the moon shadow of the moon shadow of the moon

 all that we can do is just survive all that we can do to help ourselves is stay alive all that we can do is just survive all that we can do to help ourselves is stay alive 
 ragged lines of ragged grey skeletons they shuffle away shouting guards and smoking guns will cut down the unlucky ones 
 i clutch the wire fence until my fingers bleed a wound that will not heal a heart that cannot feel hoping that the horror will recede hoping that tomorrow well all be free 
 sickness to insanity prayer to profanity days and weeks and months go by dont feel the hunger too weak to cry 
 i hear the sound of gunfire at the prison gate are the liberators here do i hope or do i fear for my father and my brother its too late but i must help my mother stand up straight 
 are we the last ones left alive are we the only human beings to survive are we the last ones left alive are we the only human beings to survive

 sun been down for days a pretty flower in a vase a slipper by the fireplace a cello lying in its case 
 soon shes down the stairs her morning elegance she wears the sound of water makes her dream awoken by a cloud of steam she pours a daydream in a cup a spoon of sugar sweetens up 
 and she fights for her life as she puts on her coat and she fights for her life on the train she looks at the rain as it pours and she fights for her life as she goes in a store with a thought she has caught by a thread she pays for the bread and she goes 
 nobody knows 
 sun been down for days a winter melody she plays the thunder makes her contemplate she hears a noise behind the gate perhaps a letter with a dove perhaps a stranger she could love 
 and she fights for her life as she puts on her coat and she fights for her life on the train she looks at the rain as it pours and she fights for her life as she goes in a store with a thought she has caught by a thread she pays for the bread and she goes 
 nobody knows nobody knows 
 and she fights for her life as she puts on her coat and she fights for her life on the train she looks at the rain as it pours and she fights for her life as she goes in a store where the people are pleasently strange and counting the change 
 as she goes nobody knows nobody knows nobody knows

 i would not have believed you had i never seen now you and i are intimately pictured in my dreams i could not forsake you or fall tumbling away and if i live in wonderland im better off this way 
 i choose never to forget i want our lips to kiss and our limbs to entwine let our bodies be twisted but never our minds 
 is this love is this love is this love is this love 
 set to work idle hands shake these thoughts had i planned them they never would be teasing me as viciously as these

 oh simple thing where have you gone im getting old and i need something to rely on so tell me when youre gonna let me in im getting tired and i need somewhere to begin

 to the rhythm of the awful rusted machines we toss and turn but dont sleep each breath we take makes us thieves like causes without rebels just talk but promise nothing else 
 we crawl on our knees for you under a sky no longer blue we sweat all day long for you but we sow seeds to see us through cause sometimes dreams just dont come true we wait to reap what we are due 
 to the rhythm of a time bomb ticking away and the blare of the sirens combing the streets chased down like dogs we run from your grasp until the sun comes up 
 we crawl on our knees for you under a sky no longer blue we sweat all day long for you but we sow seeds to see us through cause sometimes dreams just dont come true look now at what theyve done to you whoa 
 oh whoa ooh whoa white needles buried in the red the engine roars and then it gives but never dies cause we dont live we just survive on the scraps that you throw away hey 
 i wont crawl on my knees for you i wont believe the lies that hide the truth i wont sweat one more drop for you cause we are the rust upon your gears we are the insect in your ears we crawl we crawl we crawl all over you 
 we sow seeds to see us through our days are precious and so few we all reap what we are due under this sky no longer blue we bring a dawn long over due we crawl and we crawl and we crawl all over you

 you do something to me that i caaaant explain so would i be out of line if i said i miss you 
 i see your picture i smell your skin on the empty pillow next to mine you have only been goneten days but already i am wasting away 
 i know illsee you again whether faaaar or soon but i need you to knoow that i care and i miss you 
 you take my breathe away but i never tasted your lips as fate keeps me locked away i must close my eyes to see your face 
 emptiness has darkened my eyes as i hopelessly beg for my life to end tell me why my iron eyes tell the tale heroes always pay in their blood 
 i see the fear growing in their lost eyes my purpose is so clear i am the ax i am the ax and this is why i must not fear the end and when im gone will you forget mee pen wears its steady course across the page resigned to its designs to take the hive 
 emptiness has darkened my eyes as i hopelessly beg for my life to end tell me why emptiness 
 has darkened my eyes as i hopelessly beg for my life to end tell me why my iron eyes tell the heroes always pay in their blood i am the ax fear has been lost to faith the darkened night has come before the end of which we must prevail 
 admist the pitch of steel we shall arise i will destroy all those who oppose me my iron eyes tell the tale heroes always pay in their blood my iron eyes 
 tell the tale heroes always pay in their blood 
 i see the fear growing in 
 and finally the silence looking out looking back across the sky trying to find a meaning knowing that i just left it all behind still i smell a lingering softness where did she go how did she go i wanna wanna know i wanna know that shell be coming here to me 
 come on without you ill never feel the love inside of me come on you know that we belong come on come on come on come on 
 thinking back before her i never knew the meaning of alone still the flag is feeling foreign i live the day to escape into a phone speaking of a world not real then where did she go how did she go i wanna wanna know i wanna know that shell be coming here to me 
 come on without you ill never feel the love inside of me come on you know that we belong come on come on come on come on 
 cause each of her kisses how my heart misses shes coming shes coming here to me im needing desiring to kiss her now im living for her breathing for her singing for her fairytale 
 come on without you ill never feel the love inside of me come on you know that we belong come on come on come on come on 
 come on without you ill never feel the love inside of me come on come on come on come on come on 
 cant you see that i wanna be there with open arms its empty tonight and im all alone get me through this one

 suzanne takes you down to her place near the river you can hear the boats go by you can spend the night beside her and you know that shes half crazy but thats why you wanna be there and she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from china and just when you mean to tell her that you have no love to give her then she gets you on her wavelength and she lets the river answer that youve always been her lover 
 and you want to travel with her and you want to travel blind and you know she will trust you for youve touched her perfect body with your mind 
 and jesus was a sailor when he walked upon the water and he spent a long time watching from his lonely woodden tower and when he knew for certain only drowning men could see him he said all men will be sailors then until the sea shall free them but he himself was broken long before the sky would open foresaken almost human he sank beneath your wisdom 
 like a stone and you want to travel with him and you want to travel blind and you think maybe youll trust him for hes touched your perfect body with his mind 
 now suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river she is wearing rags and feathers from salvation army counter and the sun pours down like honey on our lady of the harbour and she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers there are heroes in the seaweed there are children in the morning they are leaning out for love they will lean that way forever while suzanne holds the mirror 
 and you want to travel with her and you want to travel blind and you know you can trust her for shes touched your perfect body with her mind 
 some say love it is a river that drowns the tender reed some say love it is a razor that leaves your soul to bleed 
 some say love it is a hunger an endless aching need i say love it is a flower and you its only seed 
 its the heart afraid of breaking that never learns to dance its the dream afraid of waking that never takes the chance 
 its the one who wont be taken who cannot seem to give and the soul afraid of dying that never learns to live 
 and the night has been too lonely and the road has been too long and you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong 
 just remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snow lies the seed that with the suns love in the spring becomes a rose 
 how many times have i noticed that our eyes hardly ever meet from your judgment seat i can feel the anger for my very being fill me in on when you became such a big part of my life 
 i should bother with all your lies designed to bring me down wrong again dont depend on any reaction again i remember the icy walls that shot up from no where and i can see every lie youve ever told yourself you bleed me dry and i dont ask why but im left with the dust judas kiss i dismiss thank you all for this i am untouched 
 i am un wait again im not through with the screaming i contend that youve got nothing better to do 
 and trade my life for a barrel of gold find someone else before i get too old if i live my life foraesthetic gain will you repay me with all your shame 
 i can see every light inside your brain go on every time that i walk by for nods and whispers your comfort is my suffering is no longer disturbing im lost beyond your petty stopwatch in lifes real time 
 in life real wait again im not through with the screaming i contend that youve got nothing better to do 
 and trade my life for a barrel of gold find someone else before i get too old if i live my life for aesthetic gain will you repay me with all your shame 
 dont get up i was slowly leaving the room when the door of your judgment swings back around again maybe ill stop to watch you and ill go on my way ive seen quite enough of too many childish games

 ive got the gift of one liners and youve got the curse of curves and with this gift i compose words and the question that comes forward are you perspiring from the irony or sweatin to these lyrics 
 and this just in youre a dead fit but my wit wont allow it the inside lingo had me at hello and we go where the money goes the inside lingo had me at hello and we go where the money goes 
 i want some one provocative and talkative but its so hard when youre shallow as a shower and from what ive heard with skin youll win 
 her bone structure screams touch her touch her and shes got the curse of curves so with the combination of my gift with one liners and my way my way with words 
 it seems im too hip to keep tight lipped and youre on the gossip team youre making something out of nothing and jealousys the cousin the cousin of greed the inside lingo had me at hello and we go where the money goes the inside lingo had me at hello and we go where the money goes 
 i want some one provocative and talkative but its so hard when youre shallow as a shower and from what ive heard with skin youll win 
 her bone structure screams touch her touch her and shes got the curse the curse of from what ive heard with skin youll win 
 we all have teeth that can bite underneath to where that reality grows yeah thats where mine go thats where mine go we all have teeth that can bite underneath to where that reality grows yeah thats where mine go when reality grows from what ive heard with skin youll win and from what ive heard with skin youll win 
 i want some one provocative and talkative but its so hard when youre shallow as a shower and from what ive heard with skin youll win 
 her bone structure screams touch her touch her and shes got the curse the curse of from what ive heard with skin youll win with skin youll win with skin youll win 
 when you hold me in the street and you kiss me on the dancefloor i wish that it could be like that why cant it be like that cause im yours 
 we keep behind closed doors every time i see you i die a little more stolen moments that we steal as the curtain falls itll never be enough 
 its obvious youre meant for me every piece of you it just fits perfectly every second every thought im in so deep but ill never show it on my face 
 but we know this we got a love that is homeless 
 why cant you hold me in the street why cant i kiss you on the dancefloor i wish that it could be like that why cant we be like that cause im yours 
 when youre with him do you call his name like you do when youre with me does it feel the same would you leave if i was ready to settle down or would you play it safe and stay 
 girl you know this we got a love that is hopeless 
 why cant you hold me in the street why cant i kiss you on the dancefloor i wish that it could be like that why cant we be like that cause im yours 
 and nobody knows im in love with someones baby i dont wanna hide us away tell the world about the love we making im living for that day someday 
 can i hold you in the street why cant i kiss you on the dancefloor woah i wish that we could be like that why cant we be like that cause im yours im yours 
 oh why cant you hold me in the street why cant i kiss you on the dancefloor i wish that it could be like that why cant it be like that cause im yours 
 why cant i say that im in love i wanna shout it from the rooftops i wish that it could be like that why cant we be like that cause im yours 
 why cant we be like that wish we could be like that 
 where did we go when was the moment that we broke in two i think i know in fact i am sure i can blame it on you 
 i remember the first big surprise the day you came home with your infrared eyes i looked inside them but all i could see were tiny reflections of me 
 but its not me its you what youre turning into is some kind of something that i never knew you used to be ok and i liked you that way but i dont think that i like you better no i dont think that i like you better 
 started out small some gills and some wings and a few extra thumbs now youre thirteen feet tall even when youre asleep your machinery hums 
 and im tired of the evenings i spend making small talk with your new robot friends and their stupid insistence on scanning my iris when they know damn well who i am 
 and you look like the victim of a surgical crime a little darth vader a little optimus prime you used to be ok and i liked you that way but i dont think that i like you better no i dont think that i like you better 
 so thats how it goes snap your mandibles once to say you understand now hold me close wait now thats too close youre crushing my hand 
 i can tell by that shrieking alarm that your weapon systems are active and armed do me a favor and power them down just so we dont have a scene 
 and i wish it was different but were just not the same at least we got someone we know we can blame you used to be ok and i liked you that way but i dont think that i like you better no i dont think that i like you better 
 hear footsteps creak the floor the shadows give away someone outside the door wont let em in 
 lifedamaged gears to grind a rundown broke machine that steals your peace of mind before you know its gone 
 lay down way silence burning hold your tongue keep us separate sullen dumb 
 hiding in a darkness under boiling to the surface stumble 
 a looking in view too long on the outside desperate plans make sense in a low life 
 ah a looking in view too long on the outside desperate plans make sense in a low life 
 ah these things i hate in you also reflect it seems distortion laced with spite takes you out of me 
 lay now lay hiding in a darkness under boiling to the surface something crawling on your skin discomfort makes you break and run stumble 
 a looking in view too long on the outside desperate plans make sense in a low life 
 ah a looking in view too long on the outside desperate plans make sense in a low life 
 ah its why you never tell me whatevers on your miind 
 its why you never tell me whatevers on your miind 
 its why you never tell me whatevers on your miind 
 its why you never tell me whatevers on your 
 a looking in view too long on the outside desperate plans make sense in a low life 
 ah a looking in view too long on the outside desperate plans make sense in a low life 
 ah its why you never tell me whatevers on your miind 
 as your bony fingers close around me long and spindly death becomes me heaven can you see what i see hey you pale and sickly child youre death and living reconciled been walking home a crooked mile 
 paying debt to karma you party for a living what you take wont kill you but careful what youre giving

 we all came out to montreux on the lake geneva shoreline to make records with a mobile we didnt have much time 
 oh frank zappa and the mothers were at the best place around but some stupid with a flare gun burned the place to the ground 
 smoke on the water a fire in the sky smoke on the water 
 it burned down the gambling house it died with an awful sound ah funky claude was running in and out pulling kids out the ground 
 when it all was over we had to find another place but swiss time was running out it seemed that we would lose the race 
 smoke on the water a fire in the sky smoke on the water 
 we ended up at the grand hotel it was empty cold and bare but with the rolling truck stones thing just outside hah making our music there 
 with a few red lights a few old beds we made a place to sweat no matter what we get out of this i know i know well never forget 
 smoke on the water a fire in the sky smoke on the water

 she may be the face i cant forget the trace of pleasure or regret may be my treasure or the price i have to pay she may be the song the summer sings may be the chill the autumn brings may be a hundred different things within the measure of a day 
 she may be the beauty or the beast may be the famine or the feast may turn each day into a heaven or a hell she may be the mirror of my dreams the smile reflected in a stream she may not be what she may seem inside her shell she who always seems so happy in a crowd whos eyes can be so private and so proud 
 no ones allowed to see them when they cry she may be the love that cannot hope to last that comes indeed from shadows in the past that i remember till the day i die 
 she may be the reason i survive the why and where for im alive the one ill care for through the rough and ready years me ill take her laughter and her tears and make them all my souvenirs for where she goes ive got to be the meaning of my life is she she she

 down beyond these city streets through gutters filled with black debris in alleys void of any light where nameless things live out of sight down through the scrapers of the sky 
 past neon words glowing all night echoes my name between each car are you happy where you are blind to this impending fate we let the world carry our weight its back breaks with every mile but we all live in denial

 while every breath that we take we only sufocate brush past a myriad of scenes a homeless vet chrashed on wall street a single mom of three a tv personality 
 blind to this impending fate they let the world carry their weight its back breaks with every mile but they all live in denial 
 can we be saved has the damage all been done is it too late to reverse what weve begun a lesson to learn at a crucial point in time whats mine was always yours and yours is mine 
 save us from what we have become tonight eyes glazed with distrust no sense of wrong or right

 blame it all on my roots i showed up in boots and ruined your black tie affair the last one to know the last one to show i was the last one you thought youd see there 
 and i saw the surprise and the fear in his eyes when i took his glass of champagne i toasted you said honey we may be through but youll never hear me complain

 im not big on social graces i think ill slip on down to the oasis oh ive got friends in low places 
 well i guess i was wrong i just dont belong but then ive been there before everythings all right ill just say good night and ill show myself to the door

 did you feed us tales of deceit conceal the tongues who need to speak subtle lies and a soiled coin the truth is sold the deal is done but dont despair this day will be their damndest day oh if you take these things from me 
 undefied no signs of regret your swollen pride assumes respect talons fly as a last disguise but no return the time has come so dont despair this day will be their damndest day oh if you take these things from me oh if you take these things from me 
 never really said too much afraid it wouldnt be enough just try to keep my spirits up when theres no point in grieving doesnt matter any way words could never make me stay words will never take my place when you know im leaving 
 try to leave a light on when im gone something i rely on to get home one i can feel at night a naked light a fire to keep me warm try to leave a light on when im gone even in the daylight shine on and when its late at night you can look inside you wont feel so alone

 from the top to the bottom bottom to top i stop at the core ive forgotten in the middle of my thoughts taken far from my safety the picture is there the memory wont escape me but why should i care 
 theres a place so dark you cant see the end skies cock back and shock that which cant defend the rain then sends dripping acidic questions forcefully the power of suggestion then with the eyes shut looking thought the rust and rot and dust a small spot of light floods the floor and pours over the rusted world of pretend and the eyes ease open and its dark again 
 from the top to the bottom bottom to top i stop at the core ive forgotten in the middle of my thoughts taken far from my safety the picture is there the memory wont escape me but why should i care 
 in the memory youll find me eyes burning up the darkness holding me tightly until the sun rises up 
 moving all around screaming of the ups and downs pollution manifested in perpetual sound the wheels go round and the sunset creeps behind street lamps chainlink and concrete 
 a little piece of paper with a picture drawn floats on down the street till the wind is gone and the memory now is like the picture was then when the papers crumpled up it cant be perfect again 
 from the top to the bottom bottom to top i stop at the core ive forgotten in the middle of my thoughts taken far from my safety the picture is there the memory wont escape me but why should i care 
 from the top to the bottom bottom to top i stop at the core ive forgotten in the middle of my thoughts taken far from my safety the picture is there the memory wont escape me but why should i care

 now you got me caught in the act you bring the thought back im telling you that i see it right through you

 where people drown and people serve dont be shy your just dessert is only just light years to go 
 me my thoughts are flower strewn ocean storm bayberry moon ive got to leave to find my way 
 watch the road and memorize this life that pass before my eyes nothing is going my way 
 the ocean is the rivers goal a need to leave the water knows were closer now than light years to go 
 i have got to find the river bergamot and vetiver run through my head and fall away 
 leave the road and memorize this life that pass before my eyes nothing is going my way 
 theres no one left to take the lead but i tell you and you can see were closer now than light years to go 
 pick up here and chase the ride the river empties to the tide fall into the ocean 
 the river to the ocean goes a fortune for the undertow none of this is going my way 
 there is nothing left to throw of ginger lemon indigo coriander stem and rows of hay 
 strength and courage overrides the privileged and weary eyes of river poet search naivete 
 pick up here and chase the ride the river empties to the tide all of this is coming your way

 merely the sound of your voice made me believe that that you were her just like the river disturbs my inner peace once i believed i could find just a trace of her beloved soul once i believed she was all then she smothered my believes 
 one cold winters night i may follow her voice to the river leave me for now and forever leave while you can 
 somewhere in time i will find you and haunt you again like the wind sweeps the earth somewhere in time when no virtues are left to defend youve fallen deep i was a liar in every debate i rule the forces that fueled your hate when the cold in my heart leaves it comes to an end quietly ill go to sleep 
 how could that first time recur when memories linger on and on what made me think you were her helena is dead to all dead to all 
 nothing can bring her to life dont pretend that ill be loving you once i believed she was gone i corrupted from within 
 leave leave me for now and forever leave what you can 
 somewhere in time i will find you and haunt you again like the wind sweeps the earth somewhere in time when no virtues are left to defend youve fallen deep i was a liar in every debate i rule the forces that fueled your hate when the cold in my heart leaves it comes to an end quietly ill go to 
 follow me into the light like ice on a lake of tears ill take you through leave me tonight ive gone too far to begin all anew with someone like you 
 somewhere in time i will find you and haunt you again like the wind sweeps the earth somewhere in time when no virtues are left to defend youve fallen deep i was a liar in every debate i rule the forces that fueled your hate when the cold in my heart leaves it comes to an end quietly ill go to sleep 
 ah ah ah take a breath take it deep calm yourself he says to me if you play you play for keeps take the gun and count to three im sweating now moving slow no time to think my turn to go 
 and you can see my heart beating you can see it through my chest that im terrified but im not leaving i know that i must pass this test so i just pull the trigger 
 say a prayer to yourself he says close your eyes sometimes it helps and then i get a scary thought that hes here means hes never lost 
 and you can see my heart beating now you can see it through my chest that im terrified but im not leaving know that i must pass this test so i just pull the trigger 
 as my life flashes before my eyes im wondering will i ever see another sunrise so many wont get the chance to say goodbye but its too late to pick up the value of my life 
 and you can see my heart beating now you can see it through my chest that im terrified but im not leaving no know that i must pass this test 
 and you can see my heart beating oh you can see it through my chest i am terrified but im not leaving no know that i must pass this test so i just pull the trigger 
 on the corner of main street just tryin to keep it in line you say you wanna move on and you say im falling behind 
 can you read my mind can you read my mind 
 i never really gave up on breakin out of this twostar town i got the green light i got a little fight im gonna turn this thing around 
 can you read my mind can you read my mind 
 the good old days the honest man the restless heart the promised land a subtle kiss that no one sees a broken wrist and a big trapeze 
 oh well i dont mind if you dont mind cause i dont shine if you dont shine before you go can you read my mind 
 its funny how you just break down waiting on some sign i pull up to the front of your driveway with magic soaking my spine 
 can you read my mind can you read my mind 
 the teenage queen the loaded gun the drop dead dream the chosen one a southern drawl the world unseen a city wall and a trampoline 
 oh well i dont mind if you dont mind cause i dont shine if you dont shine before you jump tell me what you find when you read my mind 
 solo slipping in my faith until i fall you never returned that call woman open the door dont let it sting i wanna breathe that fire again 
 she said i dont mind if you dont mind cause i dont shine if you dont shine put your back on me put your back on me put your back on me 
 the stars are blazing like rebel diamonds cut out of the sun can you read my mind 
 baby when i saw you turning at the end of the street i knew a time was gone and it took me like ages just to understand that i was afraid to be a simple guy i tried my best to smile but deep inside of my heart 
 i felt it was shauting like a crowd dancing i guess i couldnt live without the things that made my life what it is cant you hear me calling ooh yeh everybodys dancing ooh yeh tonight everything is over i feel too young

 mama never set a good example daddy never held mamas hand mama found everything hard to handle daddy never stood up like a man 
 ive walked around broken emotionally frozen getting it on getting it wrong 
 how do you love someone without getting hurt how do you love someone without crawling in the dirt so far in my life the clouds have blocked the sun how do you love 
 how do you love someone how do you love how do you love someone i was always the chosen child their biggest scandal i became they told me id never survive but survivals my middle name 
 ive walked around hoping just barely coping getting it on getting it wrong 
 how do you love someone without getting hurt how do you love someone without crawling in the dirt so far in my life the clouds have blocked the sun how do you love 
 how do you love someone how do you love how do you love someone its hard to talk to say whats deep inside its hard to tell the truth when youve always lied 
 how do you love someone without getting hurt how do you love someone without crawling in the dirt so far in my life the clouds have blocked the sun how do you love how do you love someone how do you love someone and make it last how do you love someone without tripping on the past so far in my life the clouds have blocked the sun how do you love how do you love someone how do you love how do you love someone someone 
 its easier to run replacing this pain with something numb its so much easier to go than face all this pain here all alone 
 some thing has been taken from deep inside of me the secret ive kept locked away no one can ever see wounds so deep they never show they never go away like moving pictures in my head for years and years theyve played 
 if i could change i would take back the pain i would retrace every wrong move that i made i would if i could stand up and take the blame i would i would take all my shame to the grave 
 its easier to run replacing this pain with something numb its so much easier to go than face all this pain here all alone 
 sometimes i remember the darkness of my past bringing back these memories i wish i didnt have sometimes i think of letting go and never looking back and never moving for ward so thered never be a past 
 if i could change i would take back the pain i would retrace every wrong move that i made i would if i could stand up and take the blame i would i would take all my shame to the grave 
 just washing it aside all of the helplessness inside pretending i dontfeel mis placed its so much simpler than change 
 its easier to run replacing this pain with something numb its so much easier to go than face all this pain here all alone its easier to run its easier to go

 oh yeah 
 ohhh ohhhhh up in my lonely room when im dreaming of you oh what can i do i still need you but i dont want you now 
 from the red sky of the east to the sunset in the west we have cheated death and he has chaeted us 
 but that was just a dream and this is what it means we are sleeping and well dream for everyone 
 and the fragment remains of our memories and the shadows we made with our hands deeper grey come to form all the colors of the dawn will this journeymans day be his laast 
 i know what i want i say what i want and no one can take it awaaay i know what i want i say whay i want and no one can take it awaaay 
 i know what i want i say what i want and no one can take it awaaay i know what i want i say what i want 
 and no one can take it away aah but the memory still remains all those past years not so strange our wintertimes are like a silent shroud 
 and the heartbeat of the day drives the mist away and winters not the only dream around 
 in your life you may choose desolaation and the shadows you build with your hands if you turn to the light that is burning in the night then this journeymans day has beguun 
 i know what i want i say what i want and no one can take it awaaay i know what i want i say what i want and no one can take it awaaay 
 i know what i want i say what i want and no one can take it awaaay i know what i want i say what i want 
 and no one can take it away aah in your life you may choose desolation and the shadows you build with your hands if you turn to the light that is burning in the night then your journeymans day has beguun 
 oh i know what i want i say what i want and no one can take it awaaay i know what i want i say what i want and no one can take it awaaay 
 i know what i want i say what i want and no one can take it awaaay i know what i want i say what i want

 its shining down still long way to go where the wild waters flow and black roses fail to grow where the wild waters flow and the black roses fail to grow fail to grow 
 hear the wild horses neighing climbing on the stairs of doom to a world which is loved before behind the velvet moon 
 coming on alone out of the dark will we survive hiding the secret dungeon till the sun will rise 
 see the light leading out on there darkness its shining down still long way to go where the wild waters flow and black roses fail to grow where the wild waters flow and the black roses fail to grow 
 sometimes you wonder and look into the crystal ball theres no time for surrender with the back to the wall 
 where the wild waters flow and black roses fail to grow where the wild waters flow and the black roses fail to grow 
 will be lost forever one night one night to remember yeah yeah where the wild waters flow fail to grow where the wild waters flow 
 a salute at the threshold of the north sea of my mind and a nod to the boredom that drove me here to face the tide and swim i swim oh swim 
 dip a toe in the ocean oh how it hardens and it numbs the rest of me is a version of man built to collapse and crumb and if i hadnt come now to the coast to disappear i may have died in the landslide of rocks and hopes and fear 
 so swim until you cant see land swim until you cant see land swim until you cant see land are you a man are you a bag of sand 
 swim until you cant see land swim until you cant see land swim until you cant see land are you a man are you a bag of sand 
 up to my knees now do i wade do i dive the sea has seen my like before though 
 its my first and perhaps last time lets call me a baptist call this a drowning of the past she is there on the shoreline throwing stones at my back 
 so swim until you cant see land swim until you cant see land swim until you cant see land are you a man are you a bag of sand 
 swim until you cant see land swim until you cant see land swim until you cant see land are you a man are you a bag of sand 
 now the water is taller than me and the land is a marker line all i am is a body adrift in water salt and sky 
 so swim until you cant see land swim until you cant see land swim until you cant see land are you a man are you a bag of sand 
 swim until you cant see land swim until you cant see land swim until you cant see land are you a man are you a bag of sand 
 swim until you cant see land swim until you cant see land swim until you cant see land are you a man are you a bag of sand 
 are you a man are you a bag of sand are you a man are you a bag of sand are you a man are you a bag of sand are you a man are you a bag of sand 
 are you a man are you a bag of sand are you a man are you a bag of sand are you a man are you a bag of sand 
 trying to be misunderstood but it doesnt do me any good love the way they smiled at me held their face for eternity now let them all fly off 
 when it comes down it all comes down and you will not be found when its over its all over even if i make a sound 
 ill be misunderstood by the beautiful and good in this city none of this was planned take me by the hand just dont try and understand 
 trying to be misunderstood just a product of my childhood and still i find myself outside you cant say i havent tried perhaps i tried too hard 
 no excuses i wont apologise or justify your lies come and find metell them to melook me in the eyes 
 ill be misunderstood by the beautiful and good in this city none of this was plan take me by the hand justdont try and understand 
 cant forgive sorry to say you dont know youre gulty anyway isnt it funny how we dont speak the language of love 
 ill start this broken heart ill fix it up so it will work again better than before 
 then ill star in a mystery a tragic tale of all thats yet to come fingers crossed there will be love 
 but i get carried away with every day and every fantasy the deeper the wound the harder i swoon and wish that that was me 
 theres so much to say but no words to convey the loneliness building with each passing day but im getting used to it you have to get used to it 
 ill devise the best disguise a brand new look and take them by surprise theyll never guess whats not inside 
 ill express myself with ease with confidence and character complete with fingers crossed theyll talk to me 
 but i get carried away with every page in every magazine the cheaper the thrill the deeper i fill my head with blasphemy 
 theres so much to say but no words to convey the loneliness building with each passing day but im getting used to it you have to get used to it 
 ill destroy this useless heart ill fuck it up so itll never beat again not just for me but for anyone 
 but i get carried away with every phrase and made up malady the longer i hide behind these lies the more i disintegrate 
 theres so much to say but no words to convey the loneliness building with each passing day you never get used to it you just have to live with it 
 weve thrown away our former gods controlling our days we have created better ones so we control the way 
 we are the ones with the power to hold down the enemy ourgods are perfection and theyre protecting our lives 
 we still need some more of them to be safe from the other side as long as were stronger nothing will happen to us 
 fireflash in the night just an evil dream holy war in the sky 
 error in store one o three we watch the sun at night the pretty gods weve built ourselves now terminate our lives 
 silicone brain powered voices are cryin attack tonight our gods are now fighting in anger burnin our worlds doomsday has come there is no place to hide away future is over and there is no turnin back 
 fireflash in the night now reality holy war in the sky 
 twilight ofthe gods insanias dead and gone another world was born but the twilight soon will come 
 fireflash in the night now reality holy war in the sky 
 twilight ofthe gods insanias dead and gone another world was born but the twilight soon will come o ho o ho o ho ho

 the sun is sleeping quietly once upon a century wistful oceans calm and red ardent caresses laid to rest 
 for my dreams i hold my life for wishes i behold my night the truth at the end of time losing faith makes a crime 
 i wish for this nighttime to last for a lifetime the darkness around me shores of a solar sea oh how i wish to go down with the sun sleeping weeping with you 
 sorrow has a human heart from my god it will depart id sail before a thousand moons never finding where to go 
 two hundred twenty two days of light will be desired by a night a moment for the poets play until theres nothing left to say 
 i wish for this nighttime to last for a lifetime the darkness around me shores of a solar sea oh how i wish to go down with the sun sleeping weeping with you 
 i wish for this nighttime to last for a lifetime the darkness around me shores of a solar sea oh how i wish to go down with the sun sleeping weeping with you

 peggy came to me in my sleep in the middle of the night on a friday night last week she whispered hush child and dont be scared got me a few words of wisdom that i came back to share 
 and she said it doesnt matter where you come from it matters where you go no one gets remembered for the things they didnt do 
 i said peggy wont you stay here for a while we can drink whiskey we can play cards and we can get wild she said we can play poker and well play for keeps i only play angels lately and they never let me cheat 
 it doesnt matter where you come from it matters where you go no one gets remembered in this listless life for the things they didnt do 
 and you can say i had a good start and you could say i had class and you could say i was born beneath the ceiling made of glass but i always kept an open house and yeah i always did right by my friends and when it comes to saint peters gate i told the people remember one who needs to make amends 
 cause better times are coming better times ahead no one gets remembered my deathless child dont waste too long in bed 
 and peggy said it doesnt matter where you come from it matters where you go no one gets remembered in this listless loveless life for the things they didnt do now now now now now 
 peggy sang the blues ive been drifting off peggy sang the blues and ive drifted off peggy sang the blues and ive drifted off well peggy sang the blues peggy sang the blues 
 lets not make it into a big thing lets not get lost in this i know it is i know we could i guess we surely would lets pretend its not it doesnt mean a thing 
 lets not blow it out of all senses as though it meant so much its always thought about for weeks not evry time your lips meet mine i think of her but when her hands reach out i think of you 
 i see your face in my mind as i drive away cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way people are people and sometimes we change our minds but its killing me to see you go after all this time

 and we know its never simple never easy never a clean break no one here to save me youre the only thing i know like the back of my hand 
 and i cant breathe without you but i have to breathe without you but i have to 
 never wanted this never want to see you hurt every little bump in the road i tried to swerve people are people and sometimes it doesnt work out nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out 
 and we know its never simple never easy never a clean break no one here to save me youre the only thing i know like the back of my hand 
 and i cant breathe without you but i have to breathe without you but i have to

 ide and if we should die tonight then we should all die together raise a glass of wine for the last time calling out father oh prepare as we will watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side desolation comes upon the sky 
 now i see fire inside the mountain i see fire burning the trees and i see fire hollowing souls i see fire blood in the breeze and i hope that youll remember me 
 oh should my people fallin then surely ill do the same confined in mountain halls we got too close to the flame calling out father oh hold fast and we will watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side 
 desolation comes upon the sky now i see fire inside the mountain i see fire burning the trees and i see fire hollowing souls i see fire blood in the breeze and i hope that youll remember me 
 and if the night is burning i will cover my eyes for if the dark returns then my brothers will die and as the skys falling down it crashed into this lonely town and with that shadow upon the ground i hear my people screaming out 
 and i see fire inside the mountain i see fire burning the trees and i see fire hollowing souls i see fire blood in the breeze 
 i see fire oh you know i saw a city burning aaah i see fire feel the heat upon my skin and i see fire uuuhh and i see fire burn auburn on the mountain side

 make a nigga wanna run straight through the fence open up the fridge bout twenty times but still cant find no food in it 
 thats foolishness and sometimes i wonder why we care so much about the way we look and the way we talk and the way we act and the clothes we bought how much that cost 
 does it even really matter cause if life is an up hill battle we all tryna climb with the same ol ladder in the same boat with the same ol paddle why so shallow im just asking whats the pattern to the madness everybody aint a number one draft pick most of us aint hollywood actors 
 but if its all for one and one for all then maybe one day we all can ball do it one time for the underdogs cencerely yours from one of yall 
 i can feel your pain i can feel your struggle you just wanna live but everything so low that you could drown in a puddle thats why i gotta hold us up yeah hold us up for all the times no ones ever spoke for us 
 so every single time that they play this song you can say thats what bobby ray wrote for us when the tides get too high and the sea up underneath get so deep and you feel like youre just another person 
 getting lost in the crowd way up high in the nosebleeds uh because weve both been there yeah both of us but we still stand tall with our shoulders up and even tough we always against the odds 
 these are the things that have molded us and if life hadnt chosen us sometimes i wonder where i wouldve wound up cause if it was up to me id make a new blueprint than build it from the ground up hey 
 but if its all for one and one for all then maybe one day we all can ball do it one time for the underdogs from bobby ray to all of yall

 round like a circle in a spiral like a wheel within a wheel never ending no beginning on an everspinning reel like a snowball down a mountain or a carnival balloon like a carousel thats turning running rings around the moon like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face and the world is like an apple whirling silently in space like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind 
 like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone like a door that keeps revolving in a halfforgotten dream or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream 
 like a clock whose hands is sweeping past the minutes of its face and the world is like an apple whirling silently in space like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind 
 keys that jingle in your pocket words that jangle in your head why did summer go so quickly was it something that you said lovers walk along the shore and leave their footprints in the sand is this sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song halfremembered names and faces but to whom do they belong when you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware that the autumn leaves were turning to the color of his hair 
 like a circle in a spiral like a wheel within a wheel never ending or beginning on an everspinning reel as the images unwind like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind

 remember when there was nothing else to do but lie in bed and wonder how it was always up to you and no one else and early mornings made by warnings whats the point of the alarm that im ignoring its either raining im not complaining but waking up is hard to do so 
 turn my head its back to bed with no delay cant be bothered by the phone ten times a day why get up at morning doesnt even start til two forget reality waking up is hard to do 
 remember when we would hang out every day and we would rather not be told what to do or what to say cause nothing mattered never boring with slept in mornings not ashamed of the habits that im forming its not important if days are shortened i cant make time when nothings new cause waking up is hard to do so 
 turn my head its back to bed with no delay cant be bothered by the phone ten times a day why get up at morning doesnt even start til two forget reality waking up is hard to do 
 whats a day when it all ends up the same and lasts forever cant complain when theres no thing thereto blame and things cant be better summer evenings teenage grievings got no problem with the life that ive been leading no concentration on hesitation i cant make time when nothings new cause waking up is hard to do so 
 turn my head its back to bed with no delay cant be bothered by the phone ten times a day why get up at morning doesnt even start til two forget reality waking up is hard to do

 a long ass fuckin time ago in a town called kickapoo there lived a humble family religious through and through but yay there was a black sheep and he knew just what to do 
 his name was young j b and he refused to step inline a vision he did seeeth fuckin rockin all the time he wrote a tasty jam and all the planets did align 
 oh the dragons balls were blazin as i stepped into his cave then i sliced his fuckin cockles with a long and shiney blade 
 twas i who fucked the dragon fuckalize sing fuckaloo and if you try to fuck with me then i shall fuck you too 
 gotta get it on in the party zone i gots to shoot a load in the party zone gotta lick a toad in the party zone gotta suck a chode in the party zone 
 youve disobeyed my orders son why were you ever born your brothers ten times better than you jesus loves him more 
 this music that you play for us comes from the depths of hell rock and rolls the devils work he wants you to rebel 
 youll become a mindless puppet beelzebub will pull the strings your heart will lose direction and chaos it will bring 
 youd better shut your mouth you better watch your tone youre grounded for a week with no telephone dont let me here you cry dont let me hear you moan you gotta praise the lord when youre in my home 
 dio can you hear me i am lost and so alone im askin for your guidance wont you come down from your throne 
 i need a tight compadre who will teach me how to rock my father thinks youre evil but man he can suck a cock 
 rock is not the devils work its magical and rad ill never rock as long as i am stuck here with my dad 
 i hear you brave young jaybles you are hungry for the rock but to learn the ancient method sacred doors you must unlock 
 escape your fathers clutches and this oppressive neighborhood on a journey you must go to find the land of hollywood 
 in the city of fallen angels where the ocean meets the sand you will form a strong alliance and the worlds most awesome band 
 to find your fame and fortune through the valley you must walk you will face your inner demons now go my son and rock 
 so he went from fuckin kickapoo with hunger in his heart and he journeyed far and wide to find the secrets of his art but in the end he knew that he would find his counterpart

 i made the call just too late at the end of may i just thought i could wait for one more day in the time that passed you went down so fast you went down so fast 
 out of my reach out of my hands i didnt understand i would have changed all my plans 
 an empty house a setting sun at four am some battles fought are battles won but this aint one of them one more shadow cast you went down so fast you went down so fast 
 out of my reach out of my hands i didnt understand i would have changed all my plans 
 out of my reach out of my hands and now the leaves are turning brown i watch em blow where the earth pulls them down i let you go as your breath unwinds through the restless pines 
 out of my reach out of my hands i didnt understand i would have changed all my plans i would have changed out of my reach out of my hands i didnt understand i would have changed all my plans i would have changed 
 we are young but we have heart born in this world as it all falls apart we are strong but we dont belong born in this world as it all falls apart 
 i see the children in the rain like the parade before the pain see the love i see the hate i see this world that we can make see the life i see the sky give it all to see you fly yes we wave this flag of hatred but youre the ones who made it watch the beauty of all our lives passing right before my eyes hear the hate in all your words all the wars to make us hurt we get so sick were so sick we never wanted all this medication for the kids with no reason to live so we 
 march to the drums of the damned as we come watch it burn in the sun we are numb 
 we are young but we have heart born in this world as it all falls apart we are strong but we dont belong born in this world as it all falls apart 
 as we walk among these shadows in these streets these fields of battle take it up we wear the mantle raise your hands with burning can dles hear us whisper in the dark in the rain you see the spark feel the beating of our hearts fleeting hope as we depart all together walk alone against all weve ever known all weve ever really wanted was a place to call our home but you take all we are the innocence of our hearts made to kneel before the altar as you tear us apart so we 
 march to the drums of the damned as we come watch it burn in the sun we are numb 
 we are young but we have heart born in this world as it all falls apart we are strong but we dont belong born in this world as it all falls apart 
 we will fight or we will fall til the angels save us all we will fight or we will fall til the angels save us all we will fight or we will fall 
 til the angels save us all we will fight or we will fall til the angels save us all we are young but we have heart born in this world as it all falls apart we are strong but we dont belong born in this world as it all falls apart 
 we are young but we have heart born in this world as it all falls apart we are strong but we dont belong born in this world as it all falls apart 
 whenever i step outside somebody claims to see the light it seems to me that all of us have lost our patience cause everyone thinks theyre right and nobody thinks that there just might be more than one road to our final destination 
 but im not ever going to know if im right or wrong cause were all going in the same direction and im not sure which way to go because all along weve been going in the same direction 
 im tired of playing games of looking for someone else to blame for all the holes in answers that are clearly showing for something to fill the space was all of the time i spent a waste cause so many choices point the same way i was going 
 but im not ever going to know if im right or wrong cause were all going in the same direction and im not sure which way to go because all along weve been going in the same direction going in the same direction same direction 
 so why does there only have to be one correct philosophy i dont want to go and follow you just to end up like one of them and why are you always telling me what you want me to believe id like to think that i can go my own way and meet you in the end go my own way and meet you in the end 
 im not ever going to know if im right or wrong cause were all going in the same direction and im not sure which way to go because all along weve been going in the same direction going in the same direction going in the same direction same direction 
 once i hoped to seek the new and unknown this planets overrun theres nothing left for you or for me dont give in we can walk through the fields and feeling natures glow but all the land is owned theres none left for you or for me 
 who willwin cause i concede 
 free me free me free me from this world i dont belong here it was a mistake imprisoning my soul can you free me free me from this world a world lush and blue 
 with rivers runing wild theyll be rerouted south with none left for you or for me dont give in and hear the engies roar and save our crops from droughts but when the black golds in doubts theres none left for you or for me 
 fuse helium three our last hope 
 and free me and free me free me from this world we dont belong here it was a mistake imprisoning our souls can you free me and free me from this world 
 free me ill free you free us from this world we dont belong here it was a mistake imprssoning our souls can you free me and free me from this world 
 running around in circles feeling caged by endless rules can you free me and free me from this world ah ah ah go to sleep

 and a crowd of young boys theyre fooling around in the corner drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles they dont give a damn about any trumpet playing band it aint what they call rock and roll 
 and the sultans yeah and the sultans played creole and then the man he steps right up to the microphone and says at last just as the time bell rings good night now its time to go home then he makes it fast with one more thing we are the sultans we are the sultans of swing

 whenever she is raging she takes all life away havent you seen havent you seen the ruins of our whole world 
 she covers the earth with a breathtaking cloak the sun awakes and melts it away the world now opens its eyes and sees the dawning of a new day

 whenever she is raging she takes life away havent you seen havent you seen the ruins of our world

 drew talks to me i laugh coz its just so funny but i cant even see anyone when hes with me he says hes so in love hes finally got it right i wonder if he knows hes all i think about at night 
 hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star hes the song in the car i keep singing dont know why i do 
 drew walks by me can he tell that i cant breathe and there he goes so perfectly the kind of flawless i wish i could be she better hold him tight give him all her love look in those beautiful eyes and know shes lucky coz 
 hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star hes the song in the car i keep singing dont know why i do 
 so i drive home alone as i turn out the light i put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight 
 coz hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar the only one whos got enough of me to break my heart hes the song in the car i keep singing dont know why i do 
 hes the time taken up but theres never enough and hes all that i need to fall into 
 drew looks at me i fake a smile so he wont see 
 theres a wild wind blowing down the corner of my street every night there the headlights are 
 glowing theres a cold war coming on the radio i heard baby its a violent world 
 oh love dont let me go wont you take me where the streetlights glow i can hear it coming i can hear the sirens sound now my feet wont touch the ground 
 time came a creeping oh and times a loaded gun every road is a ray of light it goes ooooooon time only can lead you on still its such a beautiful night 
 oh love dont let me go wont you take me where the streetlights glow i can hear it coming like a serenade of sound now my feet wont touch the ground 
 gravity release me and dont ever hold me down now my feet wont touch the ground 
 marked for demolition im just a time bomb ticking inside no hope for the hopeless i can see the pieces are laid out in front of me 
 no point even asking why couldnt help even if you try step inside and you might just be the next contestant to feel the brutality 
 devastation obliteration are all in a part of exacerbation theres no explaining my situation now why does this shit keep happening to me 
 ive held on too long just to let it go now will my inner strength get me through it somehow defying the curse that has taken hold never surrender ill never be overcome 
 too dark for forgiveness i cant seem to do anything right when i try to rebuild i see my humble shelter just fall to the ground again 
 object of an evil eye no point to let anyone try take heed my friend lest you be torn asunder like all thats become of me 
 decimation disintegration all being apart of imagination theres no explaining my situation now why does this shit keep happening to me 
 ive held on too long just to let it go now will my inner strength get me through it somehow defying the curse that has taken hold never surrender ill never be overcome 
 solo ive held on too long just to let it go now will my inner strength get me through it somehow defying the curse that has taken hold never surrender ill never be overcome

 since the darkness took our minds they burned our courage many died had to leave it all behind rebuilt our lives passing memories remained it made my soul a burning flame haunted dreams of my desire reveal my name raise our swords we fight for life shields and armor shining bright strike like dragons have no fear swords are made of steel 
 fly across the high seas and mountains rise above the golden horizon far away beyond the gates of space and time through the wastelands forever and on still we fight on for our freedom the cry of the fallen souls bleeding forever journey through the lands of ice and snow will we face all the fears of the world the cry of the brave 
 since the time we saw the sign destruction of your feeble mind centuries have come and gone but nothings changed hopes and dreams have disappeared destruction of your kind is near trapped inside your suffering eternal flame 
 search the darkness search the light fierce resistance what a fight glory for unholy seal lies all cast in steel 
 fly across the high seas and mountains rise aabove the golden horizon far away beyond the gates of space and time through the wastelands forever and on still we fight on for our freedom the cry of the fallen souls bleeding forever journey through the lands of ice and snow will we face all the fears of the world the cry of the brave 
 in the depths of your desire so secretly you feed the fire burning through the memories of all our lives watch the day turn into night you reach out for the guiding light first to be the one to hear their blinding lies 
 fear the darkness fear of light sucked in by their ancient might ruthless in what you may feel when you mind they steal 
 fly across the high seas and mountains rise above the golden horizon far away beyond the geates of space and time through the wastelands forever and on still we fight on for our freedom the cry of the fallen souls bleeding forever journey through the lands of ice and snow will we face all the fears of the world the cry of the brave 
 i remember careless days on the waterfront birds and sidewalks ice cream parlors to slow us off we had everything we needed and the air was filled with gasoline and dust 
 we would walk back home again on deserted streets slept with open windows keeping our nightmares clean we were ignorant and beautiful and blinded by the brightly shining light 
 will it ever be repeated will it follow anywhere will we spend our time reflecting are we old enough to care 
 i recall the summer heat on a sunkissed face hanging by the highway we had a perfect place we were revelling each other but we never saw the panic in our eyes 
 will it ever be repeated will it follow anywhere will we spend our time reflecting are we old enough to care 
 could you fill me up again please im still thirsty and the rest of it can wait 
 will it ever be repeated will it follow anywhere will we spend our time reflecting are we old enough to care 
 will it ever be repeated will it follow anywhere will we spend our time reflecting are we old enough to care

 youre now destined to be the last one standing in the past will lie to me and mocking hope is all i had 
 you had weakness it hides from me and then it infiltrates my heart 
 so wrong to think i had found it was so long since i felt that at all i had dreamed long in days without i had so long wanted something much more 
 those looks so lovingly caress my thoughts and still today they scream to me their sweet warmth moistening my breath 
 i may never get away your crave i hunger 
 so wrong to think i had found it was so long since i felt that at all i had dreamed long in days without i had so long wanted something much more

 we come from over the dark horizon sky with twisted tales of sacrifice to imagine or believe al the glory of the free 
 hunting all day an endless cry the things ive seen i cant deny sinners saints all mixed in one the dawn of time has begun 
 why can you see what theyre doing to me is it fair that im dieing in vain 
 once in a land of sacrifice now only valleys of demise shadows of a pale blue moonlight ride the waves of entity 
 why cant you see what theyre doing to thee is it fair that you all die in vain 
 ride with the steel and the power of the sword stand up and fight now and forever more rise through the night sky with daylights desire to be free there must be black fire 
 through the day and throught the night with dragons heart the warrior strikes this is the day that theyll be known as my enemy why cant you see what theyre doing to what we believe in we rise through the pain 
 ride with the steel and the power of the sword stand up and fight now and forever more rise thought the night sky with daylights desire to be free there must be black fire

 i found myself alone alone alone above a raging sea that stole the only boy i loved and drowned him deep inside of me 
 you soft and only you lost and lonely you just like heaven 
 you soft and only you lost and lonely you just like heaven 
 wake up to the blue sky grab your shades and lets go for a ride breakfast by the ocean well do lunch at sunset vine

 seven seas swimming them so well glad to see my face among them kissing the tortoise shell 
 a longing for some fresher feeling belonging or just forever kneeling wheres the sense in stealing without the grace to be it 
 seven seas swimming them so well glad to see my face among them kissing the tortoise shell 
 burning my bridges and smashing my mirrors turning to see if youre cowardly burning the witches with mother religious youll strike the matches and shower me in water games washing the rocks below taught and tamed in time with tear flow 
 seven seas swimming them so well glad to see my face among them kissing the tortoise 
 seven seas swimming them so well glad to see my face among them kissing the tortoise

 the day the river freezes is the day it wont seem fair cos theyll come to get the river lady and i dont think theyll care 
 i know theyll scrape her paint off in their same old foolish ways now the people see the river but the old ships gone away 
 water turns cold and gets to freezing before you even know it the old girls easing away from her berth round by the point and out of our view 
 off in the mist her engines pounding back on the banks that old horns sounding a little good bye a little ill do what i must do 
 a little good bye a little ill do what i must do 
 i know i will remember when i cannot hear that horn that would roll up by the mountains as she took us through the storm 
 i know theyve got to take her but i cant say i approve cos shes won so many battles that i hate to see her lose 
 water turns cold and gets to freezing before you even know it the old girls easing away from her berth round by the point and out of our view 
 off in the mist her engines pounding back on the banks that old horns sounding a little good bye a little ill do what i must do 
 a little good bye a little ill do what i must do 
 water turns cold and gets to freezing before you even know it the old girls easing away from her berth round by the point and out of our view

 the clouds never expect it when it rains but the sea changes colors but the sea does not change so with the slow graceful flow of age i went forth with an age old desire to please on the edge of seventeen oh

 you take a deep breath and you walk through the doors its the morning of your very first day you say hi to your friends you aint seen in a while try and stay out of everybodys way 
 its your freshman year and youre gonna be here for the next four years in this town hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say you know i havent seen you around before 
 cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you youre gonna believe them and when youre fifteen 
 feeling like there nothing to figure out well count to ten take it in this is life before you know who youre gonna be fifteen you sit in class next to a redhead named abigail and soon enough youre best friends laughing at the other girls who think theyre so cool well be out of here as soon as we can 
 and then youre on your very first date and hes got a car and youre feeling like flying 
 and youre mommas waiting up and you think hes the one and youre dancing round your room when the night end when the night ends cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you 
 youre gonna believe them and when youre fifteen and your first kiss makes your head spin round but in your life youll do things greater than dating the boy of the football team but i didnt know it at fifteen 
 when all you wanted was to be wanted wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now 
 back then i swore i was gonna marry him someday but i realized some bigger dreams of mine and abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind and we both cried 
 cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you youre gonna believe them and when youre fifteen dont forget to look before you fall ive found that time can heal most anything and you just might find who youre supposed to be i didnt know who i was supposed to be fifteen la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la 
 la la la la la la your very first day take a deep breath girl take a deep breath as you walk through those doors

 do you have the time to listen to me whine about nothing and everything all at once i am one of those melodramatic fools neurotic to the bone no doubt about it 
 sometimes i give myself the creeps sometimes my mind plays tricks on me it all keeps adding up i think im cracking up am i just paranoid or im just stoned 
 i went to a shrink to analyze my dreams she says its lack of sex thats bringing me down i went to a whore he said my lifes a bore so quit my whining cause its bringing her down 
 sometimes i give myself the creeps sometimes my mind plays tricks on me it all keeps adding up i think im cracking up am i just paranoid uh yuh yuh ya 
 grasping to control so i better hold on 
 sometimes i give myself the creeps sometimes my mind plays tricks on me it all keeps adding up i think im cracking up am i just paranoid or im just stoned 
 all wound up on the edge terrified 
 sleep disturbed restless mind spetrified 
 bouts of fear permeate all i see 
 heightening nervousness threatens me 
 i am paralyzed so afraid to die 
 caught off guard warning signs never show 
 tension strikes choking me worries grow 
 why do i feel so numb is it something to do with where i come from should this be fight or flight i dont know why im constantly so up tight 
 rapid heartbeat pounding through my chest agitated body in distress i feel like im in danger daily life is strangled by my stress 
 a stifling surge shooting through all my veins extreme apprehension suddenly im insane lost all hope for redemption a grave situation desperate at best 
 why do i feel so numb is it something to do with where i come from should this be fight or flight i dont know why im constantly reeling 
 helpless hysteria a false sense of urgency trapped in my phobia possessed by anxiety 
 run try to hide overwhelmed by this complex delirium 
 helpless hysteria a false sense of urgency trapped in my phobia possessed by anxiety 
 run try to hide overwhelmed by this complex delirium 
 i dont feel a thing and i stopped remembering days are just like moments turned hours 
 mother used to say if you want youll find a way mother never danced through fire shower

 walk in the rain in the rain in the rain i walk in the rain in the rain am i right or am i wrong is it here that i belong 
 walk in the rain in the rain in the rain i walk in the rain in the rain why do i feel so alone for some reason i think of home

 if you search for tenderness it isnt hard to find you can have the love you need to live 
 but if you look for truthfulness you might just as well be blind it always seems to be so hard to give 
 honesty is such a lonely word everyone is so untrue honesty is hardly ever heard and mostly what i need from you 
 i can always find someone to say they sympathize if i wear my heart out on my sleeve 
 but i dont want some pretty face to tell mepretty lies all i want is someone to believe 
 honesty is such a lonely word everyone is so untrue honesty is hardly ever heard and mostly what i need from you 
 i can find a lover i can find a friend i can have security until the bitter end anyone can comfort me with promises again i know i know 
 when im deep inside of me dont be too concerned i wont as for nothin while im gone 
 but when i want sincerity tell me where else can i turn because youre the one that i depend upon 
 honesty is such a lonely word everyone is so untrue honesty is hardly ever heard and mostly what i need from you

 the summer air was soft and warm the feeling right the paris night did its best to please us and strolling down the elysee we had a drink in each cafe and you you talked of politics philosophy and i smiledlike mona lisa we had our chance it was a fine and true romance 
 i can still recall our last summer i still see it all walks along the seine laughing in the rain our last summer memories that remain 
 we made our way along the river and we sat down in the grass by the eiffel tower i was so happy we had met it was the age of no regret oh yes those crazy years that was the time of the flower power but underneath we hada fear of flying of getting old a fear of slowly dying we took the chance like we were dancing our last dance 
 i can still recall our last summer i still see it all in the tourist jam round the notre dame our last summer walking hand in hand 
 paris restaurants our last summer morning croissants living for the day worries far away our last summer we could laugh and play 
 and now youre working in a bank the family man the football fan and your name is harry how dull it seems yet youre the hero of my dreams 
 i can still recall our last summer i still see it all walks along the seine laughing in the rain our last summer memories that remain 
 i can still recall our last summer i still see it all in the tourist jam round the notre dame our last summer walking hand in hand

 mary anne and wanda were the best of friends all through their high school days both members of the 4 h club both active in the ffa 
 after graduation mary anne went out lookin for a bright new world wanda looked all around this town and all she found was earl 
 well it wasnt two weeks after she got married that wanda started gettin abused she put on dark glasses and long sleeved blouses 
 and make up to cover a bruise well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce she let the law take it from there but earl walked right through that restraining order and put her in intensive care 
 right away mary anne flew in from atlanta on a red eye midnight flight she held wandas hand as they worked out a plan and it didnt take em long to decide that earl had to die goodbye earl those black eyed peas they tasted all right to me earl you feeling weak 
 why dont you lay down and sleep earl aint it dark wrapped up in that tarp earl the cops came by to bring earl in they searched the house high and low then they tipped their hats and said thank you ladies if you hear from him let us know 
 well the weeks went by and spring turned to summer and summer faded into fall and it turns out he was a missing person who nobody missed at all 
 so the girls bought some land and a roadside stand out on highway 109 they sell tennessee ham and strawberry jam and they dont lose any sleep at night cause earl had to die 
 goodbye earl we need a break lets go out to the lake earl well pack a lunch and stuff you in the trunk earl well is that all right good lets go for a ride earl hey well hey hay hey ah hey hey hey well hey hay hey 
 schoolbag in hand she leaves home in the early morning waving goodbye with an absent minded smile i watch her go with a surge of that well known sadness and i have to sit down for a while the feeling that im losing her forever and without really entering her world im glad whenever i can share her laughter that funny little girl 
 slipping through my fingers all the time i try to capture every minute the feeling in it slipping through my fingers all the time do i really see whats in her mind each time i think im close to knowing she keeps on growing slipping through my fingers all the time 
 sleep in our eyes her and me at the breakfast table barely awake i let precious time go by then when shes gone theres that old melancholy feeling and a sense of guilt i cant deny what happened to those wonderful adventures the places i had planned for us to go well some of that we did but most we didnt and why i just dont know 
 slipping through my fingers all the time i try to capture every minute the feeling in it slipping through my fingers all the time do i really see whats in her mind each time i think im close to knowing she keeps on growing slipping through my fingers all the time 
 sometimes i wish that i could freeze the picture and save it from the funny tricks of time slipping through my fingers 
 schoolbag in hand she leaves home in the early morning waving goodbye with an absent minded smile 
 when i talk about it carries on reasons only knew when i talk about it aries or treasons all renew 
 big me to talk about it i could stand to prove if we can get around it i know that its true 
 well i talked about it carried on reasons only knew but its you i fell into 
 well i talked about it carries on reasons only knew when i talk about it aries or treasons all renew 
 big me to talk about it i could stand to prove if we can get around it i know that its true 
 well i talked about it put it on never was it true but its you i fell into 
 well i talked about it put it on never was it true but its you i fell into i fell into i fell into 
 im searching through emptiness and tired to forget us in vain the light of the dark setting sun will bring my sadness to an end 
 voices cry out through the fear and the doubt as we wait for our lives to be better 
 the words are dying in the night no winter lasts forever the seasons pass and sunlight will shine on my life again so let the past now burn down in flames 
 locked in a prison in a world of living fear on the edge of my destruction marching on still suffer in darkness with the dreams of life not meant to be as i lie awake and curse the rising sun 
 sadness inside for the truth that she hides and this pain in my heart for no reason 
 the words are dying in the night no winter lasts forever the seasons pass and sunlight will shine on my life again so let the past now burn down in flames 
 stare into my eyes im burning with lust and desire wont you come down and let yourself go in the fire so leave the past behind 
 the words are dying in the night no winter lasts forever the seasons pass and sunlight will shine on my life again so leave the past behind 
 the dark clouds fading from my mind no pain will last forever the seasons pass and sunlight will shine on my life again so let the past now burn down in flames now burn down in flames ah

 summer summer summertime and just sit back and unwind 
 here it is a groove slightly transformed just a bit of a break from the norm just a little something 
 to break the monotony of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be a little bit out of control its cool to dance but what about a groove that soothes to move romance give me a soft subtle mix and if it aint broke then dont try to fix it and think of the summers of the past adjust the bass and let the alpine blast pop in my c d and let me run a rhyme and put your car on cruise and lay back 
 cause its summertime summer summer summertime summertime and just sit back and unwind 
 summer summer summertime summertime and just sit back and unwind school is out 
 and its a sort of a buzz but back then i didnt really know 
 what it was but now i see what happened is the way that people respond to summer madness the weather is hot and girls are dressing less 
 and checking out the fellas 
 to tell em whos best riding around 
 in your jeep or your benzos 
 or in your nissan 
 sitting on lorenzos 
 back in philly we be out in the park 
 a place called the plateau 
 is where everybody go guys out hunting 
 and girls doing likewise 
 honking at the honey 
 in front of you with the light eyes she turned around to see what you beepin at its like the summers a natural aphrodisiac and with a pen and pad 
 i composed this rhyme to hip you and get you equipped for the summertime summer summer summertime summertime and just sit back and unwind 
 summer summer summertime summertime and just sit back and unwind its late in the day and i aint been on the court yet hustled to the mall to get me a short set yeah i got on sneaks but i need a new pair 
 cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there the temperatures about 
 eighty eight hop in the water plug 
 just for old times sake 
 break to ya crib 
 change your clothes once more 
 cause youre invited 
 to a barbeque 
 thats starting at four sittin with your friends 
 cause yall reminisce 
 about the days growing up 
 and the first person you kissed 
 and as i think back makes me wonder how 
 the smell from a grill 
 can spark up nostalgia all the kids playing out front little boys messin around with the girls playing double dutch while the d js spinning a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion then six o clock rolls around you just finished wiping your car down its time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout it looks like a car show everybody come lookin real fine 
 fresh from the barber shop 
 or fly from the beauty salon every moment frontin and maxin 
 chillin in the car they spent all day waxin 
 leanin to the side 
 but you cant speed through two miles an hour 
 so everybody sees you theres an air of love and of happiness and this is the fresh princes new definition of summer madness summer summer summertime and just sit back and unwind 
 summer summer summertime and just sit back and unwind

 let the rain fall down let it fall to the ground let the rain fall down to the ground and the birds dont sing no they dont make a sound when youre six feet underground 
 well they cast me out when the word spread around that i never sang in the church and it took one night for the town to decide im afflicted by the curse 
 and the rain falls down let it fall to the ground and the birds dont sing no they dont make a sound so i look to the sky tell me why tell me why do they all get to live and i have to die 
 so they marched me down to the center of town with their pitchforks high in the air i was chained and bound with a blindfold around so the judge wouldnt catch my stare 
 and they hung my soul from the gallows pole but the witch they never found so to those who dont fit societys mold learn to swim or you will drown 
 and the rain falls down let it fall to the ground and the birds dont sing no they dont make a sound so i look to the sky tell me why tell me why do they all get to live and i have to die 
 and the angels sing let it shine let it shine dry the teardrops from my eyes and the bells will ring when the blind lead the blind cause the dead cant testify and because i cant take an eye for an eye in the afterlife ill haunt you till you die 
 and the rain falls down let it fall to the ground and the birds dont sing no they dont make a sound so i look to the sky tell me why tell me why do they all get to live and i have to die

 have you ever been a part of something that you thought would never end and then of course it did have you ever felt the weight inside you pulling away inside your skin and then something had to give 
 now the lines are drawn is this feeling gone the best parts of this have come and gone and now that is all this is with the reasons clear well spent another year without direction full of fear and now things will be different theres nothing simple when it comes to you and i 
 allways something in this everchanging life and it probably allways willnow that time is getting harder to come by same arguments are allways on our mind killed this slowly fading light 
 now the lines are drawn is this feeling gone the best parts of this have come and gone and now that is all that this is with the reasons clear we ll spent another year without direction full of fear but now things will be different 
 and now something has kept me here too long you cant leave me if im allready gone 
 well now something has kept me here too long and you cant leave me if im allready gone 
 now it says that something has kept me here too long and you cant leave me if im allready gone

 if you feel a hand guiding you along when the path seems wrong it will be me 
 there is no mountain that i cant climb for you id swim through the rivers of time as you go your way and i go mine a light will shine and it will be me 
 if there is a key that goes to your heart a special part it will be me 
 if you need a friend call out to the wind to hold you again it will be me 
 oh how the world seems so unfair creating a love that can not be shared as you go your way and i go mine a light will shine and it will be me 
 past the ever after theres a place for two in your tears of laughter ill be there for you 
 in the sun and the moon in the land and the sea look all around you it will be me 
 there is no mountain that i cant climb for you id swim through the rivers of time as you go your way and i go mine a light will shine and it will be me it will be me it will be me 
 long ago in days of yore it all began with a god named thor there were vikings and boats and some plans for a furniture store its not a bodega its not a mall and they sell things for apartments smaller than mine as if there were apartments smaller than mine 
 ikea just some oak and some pine and a handful of norsemen ikea selling furniture for college kids and divorced men everyone has a home but if you dont have a home you can buy one there 
 so rent a car or take the bus lay your cash down and put your trust in the land where the furniture folds to a much smaller size billy the bookcase says hello and so does a table whose name is ingo and the chair is a ladder back birch but his friends call him karl 
 ikea just some oak and some pine and a handful of norsemen ikea selling furniture for college kids and divorced men everyone has a home but if you dont have a home you can buy one there

 leave the sleep and let the springtime talk in tongues from the time before man listen to a daffodil tell her tale let the guest in walk out be the first to greet the morn 
 the meadows of heaven await harvest the cliffs unjumped cold waters untouched the elsewhere creatures yet unseen finally you number came up free fall awaits the brave 
 come chase the wild race the blind they will guide you from the light writing noughts til the end of time come surf the cloud race the dark it feeds from the runs undone meet me where the cliff greets the see 
 the answer to the riddle before your eyes is in dead leaves and fleating skies retourning swans and sedulous mice writing on the gardens book in the minute of a lovers look 
 building a sandcastle close to the shore a house of cards from a worn out deck a home from a fellowship poise and calm write a lyric for a song only you can understand 
 come chase the wild race the blind they will guide you from the light writing noughts til the end of time come surf the cloud race the dark it feeds from the runs undone meet me where the cliff greets the seeeee 
 riding hard every shooting star come to life open mind have a laugh at the orthodox come drink deep let the dam of mind seep travel with great elan dance a jig at the funeral 
 come chase the wild race the blind they will guide you from the light writing noughts til the end of time uuh come surf the cloud race the dark it feeds from the runs undone meet me where the cliff greets the seecome

 you sway when you are lost you sway when you dont know you sway and all you want is to find home 
 as the light pours in feel the volume of the sky mark your place in time with another question why tiny flickers in the night always lookin to be right through all the fights ive conquered and behold the times have changed and i will now move over slowly

 in the darkness of the night in the shadows of the dawn its turning black no looking back the sands of time are sown when the day will slowly end and the sun has turned to grey will we feel the power of freedom with the dawn of a new day 
 over mountains paved with gold and through the valleys of the slain our quest will lead us onwards to the journey of the brave when the time has come to stand for the power we believe we will ring the sound of victory for one and all to see 
 sometimes in your darkest dreams you will feel the haunting pain silent tears of your hidden fears come to haunt you once again fight on for the memories of the everlasting dream their in the sillent lands on wings of glory free we can go on forever with the darkness so far a way and the warriors who live forever fight on to the end 
 across the highest mountains and through the endless seas our journey ever onwards fight until we all be free through the darkness shining the never ending light on through the days of glory rise towards the fight 
 and one day we will find a way toward this distant golden age the cries of war will sound the day we stand before the dawn of a new world 
 on through the raging thunder across the seven seas cold winter skies are falling on the battles we have seen 
 we can go on forever with the darkness so far away and the warriors who live forever fight on to the end 
 across the highest mountains and through the endless seas our journey ever onwards fight until the end 
 across the highest mountains and through the endless seas our journey ever onwards fight until we all be free through the darkness shining the never ending light on through the days of glory rise towards the fight 
 and one day we will find a way toward this distant golden age the cries of war will sound the day we stand before the down of a new world we stand before the dawn of a new world

 let me tell you a story to chill the bones about a thing that i saw one night wandering in the everglades id one drink but no more 
 i was rambling enjoying the bright moonlight gazing up at the stars not aware of a presence so near to me watching my every move 
 feeling scared and fell to my knees as something rushed me from the trees took me to an unholy place and that is where i fell from grace 
 then they summoned me over to join in with them to the dance of the dead into the circle of fire i followed them into the middle i was led 
 as if time had stopped still i was numb with fear but still i wanted to go and the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me as i walked onto the coals 
 and i felt i was in a trance and my spirit was lifted from me and if only someone had the chance to witness what happened to me 
 and i danced and i pranced and i sang with them all had death in their eyes lifeless figures they were undead all of them they had ascended from hell 
 as i danced with the dead my free spirit was laughing and howling down at me below my undead body just danced the circle of dead 
 until the time came to reunite us both my spirit came back down to me i didnt know if i was alive or dead as the others all joined in with me 
 by luck then a skirmish started and took the attention away from me when they took their gaze from me was the moment that i fled 
 i ran like hell faster than the wind but behind i did not glance one thing that i did not dare was to look just straight ahead 
 solo when you know that your time has come around you know youll be prepared for it say your last goodbyes to everyone drink and say a prayer for it 
 when youre lying in your sleep when youre lying in your bed and you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead when youre lying in your sleep when youre lying in your bed and you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead 
 to this day i guess ill never know just why they let me go but ill never go dancing no more til i dance with the dead 
 so sorry its over so sorry its over 
 theres so much more that i wanted and theres so much more that i needed and time keeps moving on and on and on soon well all be gone 
 lets take some time to talk this over youre out of line and rarely sober we cant depend on your excuses cause in the end its fucking useless 
 you can only lean on me for so long bring this ship about to watch a friend drown stood over the ledge begged you to come down you can only lean on me for so long 
 i remember shots without a chaser absent mindedthoughts now youre a stranger cover up the scars put on your game face left you in a bar to try and save face 
 you can only lean on me for so long bring this ship about to watch a friend drown stood over the ledge begged you to come down you can only lean on me for so long 
 so sorry its over so sorry its over 
 theres so much more that i wanted and theres so much more that i needed and time keeps moving on and on and on soon well all be gone

 theres a calm surrender to the rush of day when the heat of the rolling wind can be turned away an enchanted moment and it sees me through its enough for this restless warrior just to be with you 
 and can you feel the love tonight it is where we are its enough for this wide eyed wanderer that we got this far and ca n you feel the love toni ght how its laid to rest its enough to make kings and vagabonds believe the very best 
 theres a time for evryone if they only learn that the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn theres a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors when the heart of this starcrossed voyager beats in time with yours and can you feel the love tonight it is where we are its enough for this wide eyed wanderer that we got this far 
 and can you feel the love tonight how its laid to rest its enough to make kings and vagabonds believe the very best 
 its enough to make kings and vagabonds believe the very best 
 and it starts some time a round mid night or at least thats when you loose yourself for a minute or two as you stand under the barlight and the band plays some song about forgeting yourself for a while and the piano is this melancoly soundtrack to her smile and that white dress shes wearing you havnt seen her for a while 
 but you know that shes watching shes laughing shes turning shes holding her tonic like a cross the room suddenly spining she walks up and asks how you are so you can smell her perfume you can see her lying naked in your arms 
 and so theres a change in your emotions and all these memories come rushing like feral waves to your mind of the curl of your bodies like two perfect cirles entwined and you fell hopeless and homeless and lost in the haze of the wine 
 then she leaves with someone you dont know but she makes sure you saw her she looks right at you and bolts as she walks out the door your blood boiling your stomach in ropes oh when your friends say what is it you look like youve seen a ghoost 
 then you walk under the streetlights and youre too drunk to notice that everyone is staring at you you so care what you look like the world is falling around you 
 you just have to see her you just have to see her you just have to see her you just have to see her you just have to see her you know that shell break you in two 
 oh life is bigger its bigger than you and you are not me the lengths that i will go to the distance in your eyes oh no ive said too much i set it up 
 thats me in the corner thats me in the spotlight losing my religion trying to keep up with you and i dont know if i can do it oh no ive said too much i havent said enough 
 i thought that i heard you laughing i thought that i heard you sing i think i thought i saw you try 
 every whisper every waking hour im choosing my confessions trying to keep eye on you like a hurt lost and blinded fool fool oh no ive said too much i set it up 
 consider this consider this the hints of the century consider this the slip that brought me to my knees failed what if all these fantasies come flailing around now ive said too much 
 i thought that i heard you laughing i thought that i heard you sing i think i thought i saw you try 
 that was just a dream that was just a dream

 those were the days my friend we thought theyd never end wed sing and dance forever and a day wed live the life wed choose wed fight and never loose those were the days oh yes those were the days la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la 
 i dwell on the times ive had i cant seem to leave the past ive lost who i am inside my spirit has long since died 
 my eyes they no longer see my ears they dont hear a sound my lips they have lost the taste my hands they no longer feel 
 broken and torn am i withered and worn through time so where do i go from here continue to breathe this fear

 how long should i will regret why me i have paid my dues so lost how can i be found i wish time would heal my wounds 
 this isnt living im only existing i refuse to stay here and continue to live out this lie so i shatter the hourglass hoping my time will pass ill only be noticed when my name is written in stone

 the very brightest candle of all has been extinguished smothered by those who could not bear to face reality 
 every beat of your heart tore the lies all apart made foundations quiver every wave in the lake caused the porcelain to break and i shiver 
 the leftover tallow just doesnt contain all the right answers under a sea of dust lies a vast wealth of wisdom 
 every beat of your heart tore the lies all apart made foundations quiver every wave in the lake caused the porcelain to break and i shiver 
 this black page in history is not colourfast will stain the next all what remains is just a feint of what was meant to be this black page in history is not colourfast will stain the next and nothing seems in life in dreams like what was meant to be 
 every beat of your heart tore the lies all apart made foundations quiver every wave in the lake caused the porcelain to break and i shiver 
 dear god hope you got a letter and i pray you can make it better down here i dont mean a big reduction in the price of beer but all the people that you made in your image see them starving on theit feet cause they dont get enough to eat from god dont belive in you 
 dear god sorry to disturb you but i feel that i should be heard loud and clear we all need a big reduction in a mount of tears and all the people that you made in your image see them fighting in the street cause they cant make opinions meet about god i cant belive in you 
 did you make disease and the diamond blue did you make mankind after we made you oh ah and the devil too dear god dont know if youve noticed but your name is on a lot of quotes in this book 
 and us crazy humans wrote it you should take a look and all the people that you made in your image still believe that junk is true well i know it aint and so do you dear god i cant belive in i dont belive in 
 i wont belive in heaven and hell saints no sinners no devil as well the pearly gates no thorny crown youre always letting us humans down the wars you bring the babies you drown those lost at sea and never found and its the same the whole world round 
 the hurt i see helps to compound the father and the son and the holly ghost its just somebodys unhol ly hoax and if youre up there youd perceive that my hearts here upon my sleeve if theres one thing i dont belive in 
 its you dear god 
 she was aware of her insecurities as she took the stage she was convinced if she got up there that shed be discovered someday 
 so she belted it she hit the high notes fearlessly oh she melted them as she brought them to their feet 
 she was a big star at banana joes bar where she sang karaoke every night she said if you work hard to get where you are it feels good in the hot spotlight she was a big star 
 she made the local cable shows where the camera fell in love with her face after a couple of weekends the groupies were crawlin all over the place 
 she signed autographs like she was garth brooks in a skirt and in the aftermath that small time town was hers 
 she was a big star at banana joes bar where she sang karaoke every night she said if you work hard to get where you are it feels good in the hot spotlight she was a big star 
 she doesnt care anymore that her high school girlfriends cut her down the only thought she entertains is where they are and where she is now 
 her old neighbors swear theyre certain she slept her way to the top she knows you dont get ah where youre going unless youve got something they aint got 
 so she sings tonight to twentythousand plus and the young girls scream out loud man that could be us 
 shes a big star and she eats caviar just before she performs every night she says if you work hard to get where you are it feels good in the hot spotlight shes a big star shes a big star 
 im like thomas doubting fingers routing the scars in your wrists and side touching flesh will make my mind believe 
 but i want to be like david throwing his clothes to the wind to dance a jig in my skin and be remade by your cleansing again 
 i give you myself its all that i have broken and frail im clay in your hands and im spinning unconcealed dizzy on this wheel for you mylove

 i give you myself its all that i have broken and frail im clay in your hands and im spinning unconcealed dizzy on this wheel for you mylove

 as the winter winds litter london with lonely hearts oh the warmth in your eyes swept me into your arms was it love or fear of the cold that led us through the night for every kiss your beauty trumped my doubt 
 and my head told my heart let love grow but my heart told my head 
 this time no this time no well be washed and buried one day my girl and the time we were given will be left for the world the flesh that lived and loved will be eaten by plague so let the memories be good for those who stay

 im just a lonely pilgrim i walk this world in wealth i want to know if its you i dont trust cause imdamn sure dont trust my self 
 now you play the loving woman ill play the faithful man but just dont look too close into the palm of my hand 
 we stood at the alter the gypsy swore our future was bright but come the wee wee hours maybe baby the gypsy lied 
 so when you look at me you better look hard and look twice is that me baby or just a brilliant disguise 
 tonight our bed is cold im lost in the darkness of our love god have mercy on the man who doubts what hes sure of 
 the window burns to light the way back home a light that warms no matter where theyve gone theyre off to find the hero of the day but what if they should fall by someones wicked way 
 still the window burns time so slowly turns and someone there is sighing keepers of the flames do you feel your names cant you hear your babys crying 
 mama they try and break me still they try and break me 
 excuse me while i tend to how i feel these things return to me that still seem real now deservingly this easy chair but the rocking stopped by wheels of despair

 do you remember standing on a broken field white crippled wings beating the sky the harbingers of war with their nature revealed and our chances flowing by 
 if i can let the memry heal i will remember you with me on that field when i thought that i fought this war alone you were there by my side on the frontline when i thought that i fought without a cause you gave me a reason to try 
 turn the page i need to see something new for now my innocence is torn we cannot linger on this stunted view like rabid dogs of war i will let the memry heeeal i remember you with meon that field 
 when i thought that i fought this war alone you were there by my side on the frontline and we fought to believe the impossible when i thought that i fought this war alone we were one with our destinies entwined when i thought that i fought without a cause you gave me the reason why 
 with noone wearing their real face its a whiteout of emotion and ive only got my brittle bones to break the fall when the love in letters fade its like moving in slow motion and were already too late if we arrive at all and then we caught up in the arms race an involuntary addiction and were shedding evry value our mothers taught so will you please show me your real face draw the line in the horizon 
 cos i only need your name to call the reasons why i fought when i thought that i fought this war alone you were there by my side by the frontline and we fought to believe the impossible when i thought that i fought this war alone 
 we were one with our destinies entwined when i thought that i fought without a cause you gave me the reason why 
 yeah i know who you remind me of a girl i think i used to know yeah id see her when the day got colder on those days when it felt like snow 
 you know i even think that she stared like you she used to just stand there and stare and roll her eyes right up to heaven and make like i just wasnt there 
 and she used to fall down a lot that girl was always falling again and again and i used to sometimes try to catch her but never even caught her name 
 and sometimes we would spend the night just rolling about on a floor and i remember even though it felt soft at the time i always used to wake up sore 
 you know i even think that she smiled like you she used to just stand there and smile and her eyes would go all sort of far away and stay like that for quite a while 
 and i remember she used to fall down a lot that girl was always falling again and again and i used to sometimes try to catch her but never even caught her name 
 yes i sometimes even tried to catch her but never even caught her name

 from the day that we were born weve been heading down a track sometimes its made for good sometimes for bad but if we look behind us theres a wave coming down carrying us forward to a new age 
 what about the world around us how can we fail to see and now that our fathers have gone and weve been left to carry on what about the age of reason 
 so why cant we be still why cant we love each other is kindness an ancient skill buried by our blindness and if we look behind us theres a wind blowing in to create the age of reason 
 what about the world around us how can we fail to see and now that our fathers have gone and weve been left to carry on what about the age of reason 
 if we consider carefully the options put before us so much wisdom so much love so much waiting for us and if we look ahead theres the sun and the season another day another age of reason 
 what about the world around us how can we fail to see and now that our fathers have gone and weve been left to carry on what about the age of reason 
 what about the world around us how can we fail to see and now that our fathers have gone and weve been left to carry on what about the age what about the world around us how can we fail to see

 so this time maybe lets take a photograph well burn all the negatives i hope we fall in 
 its never gonna be this good so just climb in how long till reason makes us small again it feels just like weve just got started

 its still you and the moment you met me you said i was cheap you were the sale of the century creased ourselves up on the way down 
 night time slows raindrops splash rainbows perhaps someone you know could sparkle and shine as daydreams slide to colour from shadow picture the moonglow that dazzles my eyes and i love you 
 just lying smiling in the dark shooting stars around your heart dreams come bouncing in your head pure simple everytime now youre crying in your sleep i wish youd never learned to weep dont sell the dreams you should be keeping pure simple everytime 
 dreams of sights of sleigh rides in seasons where feelings not reasons can make you decide as leaves pour down splash autumn on gardens as colder nights harden their moonlit delights and i love you 
 just lying smiling in the dark shooting stars around your heart dreams come bouncing in your head pure simple everytime now your crying in your sleep i wish youd never learned to weep dont sell the dreams you should be keeping pure simple everytime 
 look at me with starry eyes push me up to starry skies theres stardust in my head pure simple everytime fresh deep as oceans new shiver at the sight of you ill sing a softer tune pure simple over you 
 if loves the truth then look no lies and let me swim around your eyes ive found a place ill never leave shut my mouth just believe love is the truth i realize not a stream of pretty lies to use us up waste our time 
 lying smiling in the dark shooting stars around your heart dreams come bouncing in your head pure simple everytime now youre crying in your sleep wish youd never learnt to weep dont sell the dreams you should be keeping pure simple everytime 
 look at me with starry eyes push me up to starry skies theres stardust in my head pure simple everytime fresh deep as oceans new shiver at the sight of you ill sing a softer tune pure simple over you pure simple just for you

 step one you say we need to talk he walks you say sit down its just a talk he smiles politely back at you you stare politely right on through 
 some sort of window to your right as he goes left and you stay right between the lines fear and blame you begin to wonder why you came 
 where did i go wrong i lost a friend somewhere along in the bitterness and i would have stayed up with you all night had i known how to save a life 
 let him know that you know best cause after all you do know best try to slip past his defence without granting innocence 
 lay down a list of what is wrong things youve told him all along pray to god he hears you and i pray to god he hears you and 
 where did i go wrong i lost a friend somewhere along in the bitterness and i would have stayed up with you all night had i known how to save a life 
 as he begins to raise his voice you lower yours and grant him one last choice drive until you lose the road or break with the ones youve followed 
 he will do one of two things he will admit to everything or hell say hes just not the same and youll begin to wonder why you came 
 where did i go wrong i lost a friend somewhere along in the bitterness and i would have stayed up with you all night had i known how to save a life

 this was a triumph im making a note here huge success its hard to overstate my satisfaction aperture science we do what we must because we can for the good of all of us except the ones who are dead 
 but theres no sense crying over every mistake you just keep on trying till you run out of cake and the science gets done and you make a neat gun for the people who are still alive 
 im not even angry im being so sincere right now even though you broke my heart and killed me and tore me to pieces and threw every piece into a fire as they burned it hurt because i was so happy for you 
 now these points of data make a beautiful line and were out of beta were releasing on time so im glad i got burned think of all the things we learned for the people who are still alive 
 go ahead and leave me i think i prefer to stay inside maybe youll find some one else to help you may be black mesa that was a joke ha ha fat chance anyway this cake is great its so delicious and moist 
 look at me still talking when theres science to do when i look out there it makes me glad im not you ive experiments to run there is research to be done on the people who are still alive 
 and believe me i am still alive im doing science and im still alive i feel fantastic and im still alive while youre dying ill be still alive and when youre dead i will be still alive still alive still alive

 is it enough to have some love small enough to slip inside a book small enough to cover with your hand because everyone around you wants to look 
 is it enough to have some love small enough to fit inside the cracks the pieces dont fit together so good with all the breaking and all the gluing back 
 and i am still not getting what i want i want to touch the back of your right arm i wish you could remind me who i was because every day im a little further off 
 but you are my love the astronaut flying in the face of science i will gladly stay an afterthought 
 just bring back some nice reminders and is it getting harder to pretend that life goes on without you in the wake and can you see the means without the end in the random frantic action that we take 
 and is it getting easy not to care despite the many rings around your name it isnt funny and it isnt fair youve traveled all this way and its the same 
 but you are my love the astronaut flying in the face of science i will gladly stay an afterthought just bring back some nice reminders 
 i would tell them anything to see you split the evening but as you see i do not have an awful lot to tell everybodys sick for something that they can find fascinating everyone but you and even you arent feeling well 
 yes you are my love the astronaut crashing in the name of science just my luck they found your upper half its a very nice reminder its a very nice reminder 
 and you may be acquainted with the night but i have seen the darkness in the day and you must know it is a terrifying sight because you and i are living the same way

 and these wars they cant be won does anyone know or care how they begun they just promise to go on and on and on but soon we will see there can be only one

 she asked me son when i grow old will you buy me a house of gold and when your father turns to stone will you take care of me 
 i will make you queen of everything you see ill put you on the map ill cure you of disease 
 i know one day all our scars will disappear like the stars at dawn and all of our pain will fade away when morning comes and on that day when we look backwards we will see that every thing is changed and all of our trials will be as milestones on the way 
 and as long as we live every scar is a bridge to someones broken heart and theres no greater love than that one shed his blood for his friends 
 on that day all of the scales will swing to set all the wrongs to right all of our tears and all of our fears will take to flight but until then all of our scars will still remain but weve learned that if well open the wounds and share them then soon they start to heal 
 as long as we live every scar is a bridge to someones broken heart and theres no greater love than that one shed his blood for his friends 
 we must see that every scar is a bridgeand as long as we live we must open up these wounds when someone stands in your shoes and will shed his own blood theres no greater love we must open up these

 one two three four 
 shapes made of four colored blocks like a t or a box 
 come down like falling bricks 
 you can place them in rows but everybody knows that they made this game for chicks 
 mom just loves to flip and stack flip and stack grandma says this shit is like crack 
 well it is this is the game girls deserve there is no learning curve 
 which makes it great for noobs it will fill you with glee 
 especially if you have a vag and boobs 
 your mom loves it mine does too 
 mine does too call me sexist bitch its still true just kidding about the bitch part deep in a girls dainty brain 
 theres a spot near a vein which regulates their bliss once they see falling blocks the t spot unlocks 
 and they start to sing like this 
 sing lalalalalalala we love tetris lalalala 
 here is a trick i have learned to avoid getting burned 
 when you piss of your chick if you sing this on key immediately 
 shell forget that youre a dick 
 lalalalalalala lalalalalalalala tetris helps when chicks want to neuter us 
 if you love it 
 you propably have a uterus

 when i was seventeen it was a very good year it was a very good year for small town girls and soft summer nights wed hide from the lights on the village green when i was seventeen 
 when i was twenty one it was a very good year it was a very good year for city girls who lived up the stair with all that perfumed hair and it came undone when i was twenty one 
 when i was thirty five it was a very good year it was a very good year for blue blooded girls of independent means wed ride in limousines their chauffeurs would drive when i was thirty five 
 but now the days are short im in the autumn of the year and now i think of my life as vintage wine from fine older kegs from the brim to the dregs it poured sweet and clear it was a very good year 
 i wasnt jealous before we met now every woman i see is a potential threat and im possessive it isnt nice youve heard me saying that smoking was my only vice but now it isnt true now everything is new and all ive learned has overturned i beg of you 
 dont go wasting your emotion lay all your love on me 
 it was like shooting a sitting duck a little smalltalk a smile and baby i was stuck i still dont know what youve done with me a grown up woman should never fall so easily i feel a kind of fear when i dont have you near unsatisfied i skip my pride i beg you dear 
 dont go wasting your emotion lay all your love on me dont go sharing your devotion lay all your love on me 
 ive had a few little love affairs they didnt last very long and theyve been pretty scarce i used to think that was sensible it makes the truth even more incomprihensible cause everything is new and everything is you and all ive learned has overturned what can i do 
 dont go wasting your emotion lay all your love on me dont go sharing your devotion lay all your love on me 
 dont go wasting your emotion lay all your love on me dont go sharing your devotion lay all your love on me

 hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star hes the song in the car i keep singing dont know why i do 
 drew walks by me can he tell that i cant breathe and there he goes so perfectly the kind of flawless i wish i could be 
 she better hold him tight give him all her love look in those beautiful eyes and know shes lucky coz 
 hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star hes the song in the car i keep singing dont know why i do 
 so i drive home alone as i turn out the light i put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight 
 coz hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar the only one whos got enough of me to break my heart hes the song in the car i keep singing dont know why i do 
 hes the time taken up but theres never enough and hes all that i need to fall into drew looks at me i fake a smile so he wont see

 blind your eyes to what you see you cant embrace it leave it well enough alone and dont remember cut your pride and watch it bleed you cant deny it pain you know you cant ignore i dont remember 
 holding on to let them know whats given to me given to me to hide behind the mask this time and try to believe 
 if i can remember to know this will conquer me if i can just walk alone and try to escape into me

 too much too long ive waited here for you to finally come back home endless senceless reaching for the hand too far for me to touch im drifting away my heart beats in silent sounds of loneliness i fear that no one can hear when im running away to maintain my sanity its all too real for me trying to feel 
 and im drifting away my heart beats in silent sounds of loneliness i fear that no one can hear when im running away to maintain my sanity its all too real for me trying to feel without you 
 there was a man back in 95 whose heart ran out of summers but before he died i asked him wait whats the sense in life come over me come over me 
 he said son why you got to sing that tune catch a dylan song or some eclipse of the moon let an angel swing and make you swoon then you will see you will see

 picked up my kid from school today did you learn anything cause in the world today you cant live in a castle far away now talk to me come talk to me

 he said you looking for a clue i love you free 
 the batter swings and the summer flies as i look into my angels eyes a song plays on while the moon is high over me something comes over me 
 i guess were big and i guess were small if you think about it man you know we got it all cause were all we got on this bouncing ball and i love you free i love you freely

 and even though the moment passed me byi still cant turn away i saw the dreams you never thought youd lose tossed along the way letters that you never meant to send 
 lost or thrown away and now were callin up all our friends and never knew their names they dont belong to no one thats a shame 
 you could hide beside me maybe for awhile and i wont tell no one your name i wont tell em your name 
 scars are souvenirs you never lose the past is never far did you lose yourself somewhere out there did you get to be a star dont it make you sad to know that life is more than who we are 
 you grew up way to fast and now theres nothing to believe and re runs all become our history 
 a tired song keeps playing on a tired radio and i wont tell no one your name and i wont tell em your name i wont tell em your name i wont tell em your name 
 i think about you all the time but i dont need the same its lonely where you are come back down and i wont tell em your name 
 and after the storm i run and run as the rains come and i look up i look up on my knees and out of luck i look up 
 night has always pushed up day you must know life to see decay but i wont rot i wont rot not this mind and not this heart i wont rot 
 and i took you by the hand and we stood tall and remembered our own land what we lived for 
 there will come a time youll see with no more tears and love will not break your heart but dismiss your fears 
 get over your hill and see what you find there with grace in your heart and flowers in your hair 
 and now i cling to what i knew i saw exactly what was true but oh no more thats why i hold thats why i hold with all i have thats why i hold 
 and i will die alone and be left there well i guess ill just go home oh god knows where because death is just so full and man so small well im scared of whats behind and whats before 
 there will come a time youll see with no more tears and love will not break your heart but dismiss your fears 
 get over your hill and see what you find there with grace in your heart and flowers in your hair 
 there will come a time youll see with no more tears and love will not break your heart but dismiss your fears 
 get over your hill and see what you find there with grace in your heart and flowers in your hair

 a long long time ago i can still remember how that music used to make me smile and i knew that if i had my chance i could make those people dance and maybe theyd be happy for a while 
 did you write the book of love and do you have faith in god above if the bible tells you so now do you believe in rock n roll and can music save your mortal soul and can you teach me how to dance real slow 
 well i know that youre in love with him cause i saw you dancin in the gym you both kicked off your shoes man i dig those rhythm and blues 
 i was a lonely teenage broncin buck with a pink carnation and a pickup truck but i knew that i was out of luck the day the music died i started singing 
 bye bye miss american pie drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry and good old boys were drinkin whiskey and rye singin this will be the day that i die this will be the day that i die 
 i met a girl who sang the blues and i asked her for some happy news she just smiled and turned away well i went down to the sacred store where id heard the music years before 
 but the man there said the music wouldnt play well now in the streets the children screamed the lovers cried and the poets dreamed but not a word was spoken the church bells all were broken 
 and the three men i admire the most the father son and the holy ghost they caught the last train for the coast the day the music died we started singing 
 bye bye miss american pie drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry and good old boys were drinkin whiskey and rye singin this will be the day that i die this will be the day that i die 
 bye bye miss american pie drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry and good old boys were drinkin whiskey and rye singin this will be the day that i die this will be the day that i die

 i cradle your faith that reveals me grows like a flower then heals me fills me with promise anew 
 i carry your worn disillusion when my pathetic confusion kept me from speaking the truth 
 im simply a coin in your fountain lost like the seconds im counting till i am closer to you 
 i cherish every morning that found us with the night scattered around us faded and painting me blue i carry your joy in my foodsteps making my way to your harbor dont need to go any farther you are my sun and my moon 
 wrapped in your arms where its peaceful back in your arms where im happy i would do anything gladly only to see you again 
 wrapped in your arms i can wander out to the heavens above me hearing you say that you love me back in your arms where im free 
 i keep every phrase barely spoken that from your lips may have broken free as you give me your love 
 my yearning is constant and steady when im with you im already everything i can become 
 i cherish every morning that found us with the night scattered around us faded and painting me blue i carry your joy in my foodsteps making my way to your harbor dont need to go any farther you are my sun and my moon 
 wrapped in your arms where its peaceful back in your arms where im happy i would do anything gladly only to see you again 
 wrapped in your arms i can wander out to the heavens above me hearing you say that you love me back in your arms where im free 
 wrapped in your arms where its peaceful back in your arms where im happy i would do anything gladly only to see you again 
 wrapped in your arms i can wander out to the heavens above me hearing you say that you love me back in your arms where im free

 midnight not a sound from the pavement has the moon lost her memory she is smiling alone in the lamplight the withered leaves collect at my feet and the wind begins to moan 
 memory all alone in the moonlight i can dream of the old days life was beautiful then i remember the time i knew what happiness was let the memory live a gain 
 every streetlamp seems to beat a fatalistic warning someone mutters and a streetlamp sputters and soon it will be morning 
 daylight i must wait for the sunrise i must think of a new life and i mustnt give in when the dawn comes tonight will be a memory too and a new day will begin 
 burnt out ends of smoky days the still cold smell of morning a streetlamp dies another night is over another day is dawning 
 touch me its so easy to leave me all alone with my memory of my days in the sun if you touch me youll understand what happiness is look a new day has begun 
 chest to chest nose to nose palm to palm we were always just that close

 in this california king bed were ten thousand miles apart i bet california wishing on these stars for your heart for me my california king 
 eye to eye cheek to cheek side by side you were sleeping next to me 
 arm to arm dusk to dawn with the curtains drawn and a little last night on these sheets so how come when i reach out my fingers it seems like more than distance between us 
 in this california king bed were ten thousand miles apart i bet california wishing on these stars for your heart for me my california king 
 just when i felt like giving upon us you turned around and gave me one last touch that made everything feel better and even then my eyes got better 
 so confused wanna ask you if you love me but i dont wanna seem so weak maybe ive been california dreamer eh 
 in this california king bed were ten thousand miles apart bet california wishing on these stars for your heart for me my california king 
 my california king 
 in this california king bed were ten thousand miles apart i bet california wishing on these stars for your heart for me my california king

 a heart id swear id recognize is made out of my own devices could i be wrong time that ive taken i pray is not wasted have i already tasted my piece of one sweet love 
 sleepless nights you creep inside of me paint your shadows on the breath that we share you take more than just my sanity you take my reason not to care no ordinary wings ill need the sky it self will carry me back to you 
 the things i dream that i can do id open up the moon for you just come down soon 
 time that ive taken i pray is not wasted have i already tasted my piece of one sweet love 
 ready and waiting for a heart worth the breaking id settle for an honest mistake in the name of one sweet love 
 savor the sorow to soften the pain sip on the southern rain as i do i dont look dont touch dont do anything but hope that there is a you 
 the earth that is the space between id banish it from under me to get to you your unexpected love provides my solitarys suicide oh i wish i knew 
 time that ive taken i pray is not wasted have i already tasted my piece of one sweet love 
 ready and waiting for a heart worth the breaking id settle for an honest mistake in the name of one sweet love one sweet love

 he carries along from a distant place hes on his way hell bring decay in shades of grey were doomed to face the night lights out of sight since weve reached the point of no return we pray for starlight we wait for the moon the sky is empty alone in the unknown were getting nowhere 
 we have been betrayed by the wind and the rain the sacred halls empty and cold the sacrifice made should not be done in vain revenge will be taken by rome 
 we live a lie under the dying moon palefaced laughs doom indulges in delight its getting out of hand the final curtain will fall 
 hear my voice there is no choice theres no way out youll find out 
 we dont regret it so many men have failed but now hes go out and get it the madmans head it shall be thine we dont regret it that someone else dies hidden in disguise go out and get it orions hound shines bri ght 
 dont you think its time to stop the chase around the ring just stop running running round the ring dont you know that fate has been decided by the gods feel the distance distance out of reach 
 welcome to the end watch your step cassandra you may fa ll as ive stumbled on the field find myself find myself drifting away 
 and the other world the other world appe ars find myself she dies in vain i cannot be freed im fall ing down as time runs faster moves towards disaster 
 the ferryman will wait for you my dear 
 and then there was silence just a voice from the other world like a leaf in an icy world memories will fade 
 misty tales and poems lost all the bliss and beauty will be gone will my weary soul find release for a while at the moment of death i will smile its the triumph of shame and disease in the end 
 raise my hands and praise the day break the spell show me the wa y in decay the flame of troy will shine bright 
 the newborn child will carry ruin to the hall the newborns death would be a blessing to us all 
 good choice bad choice out of three youve chosen miser y 
 power and wisdom you deny bad choice bad choice 
 war is the only answer love will conquer fear so the judgements been made to the fairest the graceful says badly he fails 
 fear the heat of passion father king desire lust obsession death theyll bring shes like the sunrise outshines the moon at night precious like starlight she will bring a murderous price 
 jealousy i can clearly see the end now i can clearly see the end now the thread of life is spun the coins been placed below my tongue 
 never give up never give in be on our side so we can win never give up never give in be on our side nowhere to run 
 nowhere to hide nothing to lose like one well stand well face the storm created by a man 
 and as the lion slaughters man i am the wolf and youre the lamb 
 nowhere to run nowhere to hide nothing to lose like one well stand its all for one and one for all we live for will be wiped out 
 i feel that somethings wrong full moon your time goes by and new moons still kept out of sight 
 misty tales and poems lost all the bliss and beauty will begone will my weary soul find release for a while at the moment of death i will smile its the triumph of shame and disease in the end 
 raise my hands and praise the day break the spell show me the wa y in decay the flame of troy will shine bright 
 roam in darkness roam in darkness roam in darkness roam in darkness roam in darkness roam in darkness troy in darkness that theyve gone away and wont come back 
 theyll tear down the wall to bring it in theyll truly believe in the lie lie lie with blossoms theyll welcome the old foe 
 the visions so clear when day and dream unite the end is near you better be prepared 
 the nightmare shall be over now theres nothing more to fear come join in our singing and dance with us now the nightmare shall be over now theres nothing more to fear the war it is over forevermore 
 no hope the blind leads the blind carry on though futures denied mare or stalliontheres far more inside were in at the kill well cheerfully die 
 misty tales and poems lost all the bliss and beauty will begone will my weary soul find release for a while at the moment of death i will smile its the triumph of shame and disease in the end 
 raise my hands and praise the day break the spell show me the wa y in decay the flame of troy will shine bright 
 holy light shines on

 losing emotion finding devotion should i dress in white and search the sea as i always wished to be one with the waves o cean soul

 im aloone sitting with my broken glass my four walls folow me through my past i was on a paris train i emerged in london rain and you waiting there swimming through appologiees 
 i remember searching for the perfect words i was hoping you might change your mind i remember a soldier standing next to me riding on the metrooo 
 i was smiling as you took my hand saw the moon we spoke in france you were past the shallow words years have passed and still the hurt 
 you were past the shallow words years have passed and still the hurt i can see you now smiling as i pulled away sorry 
 i remember the leter wrinkled in my hand ill love you always filled my eyes i remember the night we walked along the seine riding on the metrooo 
 i remember a feeling coming over me then the soldier turned and walked away fuck you for loving me riding on the metrooo 
 youre my world the shelter from the rain youre the pills that take away my pain youre the light that helps me find my way youre the words when i have nothing to say 
 and in this world where nothing else is true here i am still tangled up in you im still tangled up in you still tangled up in you 
 youre the fire that warms me when im cold youre the hand i have to hold as i grow old youre the shore when i am lost at sea youre the only thing that i like about me 
 and in this world where nothing else is true here i am still tangled up in you im still tangled up in you 
 how long has it been since this story line began and i hope it never ends and goes like this forever 
 in this world where nothing else is true here i am still tangled up in you tangled up in you im still tangled up in you still tangled up in you 
 on a cobweb afternoon in a room full of emptiness by a freeway i confess i was lost in the pages 
 of a book full of death reading how well die alone and if a god well lay to rest anywhere we want to go 
 in your house i long to be room by room patiently ill wait for you there like a stone ill wait for you there alone 
 on my death bed i will pray to the gods and the angels like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven 
 to a place i recall i was there so long ago the sky was bruised the ground was bled and there you led me on 
 in your house i long to be room by room patiently ill wait for you there like a stone ill wait for you there alone alone 
 and on i read until the day was gone and i sat in regret of all the things ive done 
 for all that ive blessed and all that ive wronged in dreams until my death i will wander on 
 in your house i long to be room by room patiently ill wait for you there like a stone ill wait for you there alone alone 
 all the weights that keep me down seem heavier than before they hit me in my face though you feel nothing 
 only time will heal you say your words not therapy that half of me is gone my dearest treasure torn away 
 ill stick with you until the end of the world i cry out loud but you hear nothing ill wait for you until the end of the world my dearest treasure torn away 
 all the weights that keep me down seem heavier than before they hit me in my face though you feel nothing

 love is blind as far as the eye can see deep and meaningless words to me easy lover i need a friend road to nowhere twist and turns but will this never end 
 well my dear youll know that he pleases me but short time solution made no resolution that aint no release for me too much of something is bad enough but somethings coming over me to make me wonder too much of nothing is just as tough i need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied 
 unwrap yourself from around my finger hold me too tight or left to linger something fine built to last slipped up there i guess were running out of time too fast yes my dear you know he soothes me theres no complication theres no explanation its just a groove in me 
 too much of something is bad enough but somethings coming over me to make me wonder too much of nothing is just as tough i need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied 
 what part of no dont you understand i want a man not a boy who thinks he can boy who thinks he can 
 too much of something is bad enough but somethings coming over me to make me wonder too much of nothing is just as tough i need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied too much of nothing so why dont we give it a try too much of something were gonna be living a lie 
 if it seems a little time is needed decisions to be made hey hey hey the good advice of friends unheeded the best of plans mislaid

 keep feeling fascination passion burning love so strong keep feeling fascination looking learning moving on 
 well the truth may need some re arranging stories to be told hey hey hey and plain to see the facts are changing no meaning left to hold 
 and so the conversation turned until the sun went down and many fantasies were learned on that day 
 keep feeling fascination passion burning love so strong keep feeling fascination looking learning moving on

 theres a tall thin man standing in the shadows when he calls your name his voice is strong and clear its a dark and smoky place so you cant quite see his face he pulls you close and whispers in your ear 
 and he tells you he was born into some money but it didnt mean he had to sit around and he knows a thing or two about the things that you should do if you dont want to take life lying down 
 first of all hang out a lot with hemingway spend some time fighting bulls in spain you should go three rounds with archie moore and sugar ray so damn scary you wont mind the pain 
 be ringside at the rumble in the jungle make friends with hunter s and jackie o and when they shoot poor bobby down you wrestle sirhan to the ground love your friends and miss them when they go 
 you should write a book or two and start a magazine even if it never makes a dime you should swing out by your feet above the circus ring at the very least throw parties all the time 
 time and tide will never care not so far from here to there we just go 
 so enjoy yourself do the things that matter cause there isnt time and space to do it all love the things you try drink a cocktail wear a tie show a little grace if you should fall 
 dont live another day unless you make it count theres someone else that youre supposed to be something deep inside of you that still wants out and shame on you if you dont set it free

 down where this ugly man seeks his sustenance down in the blue midnight flare a glass hand cuts through the water scything into his twisted roots then from his eyes spring fireflies breathing life into a roaring disguise 
 needles and sins sins and needles hes gasping for air in the wishing well 
 dust to rust ashes on gashes hand around the killing jar hand around the killing jar 
 a soft hoodwink of shadow the size of make believe punching through his spike of rage a glass hand cuts through the water snuffing out the magic fury 
 oh then from inside bolt lightning cries swiftly crushed the final muffled sighs oh needles and sins sins and needles hes gasping for air in the wishing well dust to rust ashes on gashes hand around the killing jar 
 hand around the killing jar hand around the killing jar 
 hand around the killing jar hand around the killing jar 
 hand around the killing jar killing jar oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ah ah oh ah ah oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

 pop tart whats our mission do we know but never listen for too long they held me under but i hear it almost over in detroit on a memphis train like yousaid 
 its downin the heat and the summer rain of the automatic gauze of your memories down in the sleep atthe airplane races try to hold on 
 to this heart a little bitlonger try to hold on to this love aloud try to hold on for this heart a little bit colder try to hold on to this love 
 paperback scrawl your hidden poems written aroundthe dried out flowers here we are still trading places to try to hold on 
 pop tart can you envision a free world of clear division for too long they held us under but i know were geting over in detroit with the nashville tears like you said 
 its down in the heat with the broken numbers down in the gaze of solemnity down in the way youve held together try to hold on to this heart a little bit closer try to hold on to this love aloud try to hold on for this hearts a little bit order try to hold on to this love aloud 
 and we are still alive try to hold on and we have survived try to hold on and no one should deny we try to hold on 
 to thepulse of the feedback current into the flow of encrypted movement slapback kills the ancient remnants that try to hold on 
 try to hold on to this heart alive try to hold on to this love aloud try to hold on and we are still alive try to hold on and we have survived try to hold on pop tart you never listen skinned knees try to hold on stop start whats our mission skinned knees try to hold on

 its a nice day for a swim tie the weights around my feet and stumble in and dare the tide to turn 
 ive been waiting here so long hoping the answers would just somehow come along it takes time to learn but ive got no more time to burn 
 my arms feel stronger now than ever before my eyes see far beyond the tide the only sure way to lose is being afraid to choose so just decide just decide 
 it started somewhere in my chest i rest for daily work then work for daily rest but not any more i left that with my clothes back on the shore 
 my arms feel stronger now than ever before my eyes see far beyond the tide the only sure way to lose is being afraid to choose so just decide just decide 
 get over get over before they drag you under get over get over before they drag you under get over get over before they drag you under get over get over go on and take one step before that step is taken for you

 over the sidewalks running away from the streets we knew sidewalks like the time we thought was made for you

 sidewalks running away from the streets we knew sidewalks running away from the streets we knew sidewalks like the time we thought was made for you

 now this is the story all about how my life got flipped turned upside down and id like to take a minute just sit right there ill tell you how i became the prince of a town called bel air 
 in west philadelphia born and raised on the playground was where i spent most of my days chillin out maxin relaxin all cool and all shootin some bball outside of school when a couple of guys who were up to no good startin making trouble in my neighborhood i got in one little fight and my mom got scared 
 she said youre movin with your auntie and uncle in bel air i begged and pleaded with her day after day but she packed my suite case and sent me on my way she gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket i put my walkman on and said i might as well kick it 
 first class yo this is bad drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass is this what the people of bel air living like hmmmmm this might be allright 
 but wait i hear the prissy booze whine all that is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat i dont think so ill see when i get there i hope theyre prepared for the prince of bel air 
 well uh the plane landed and when i came out there was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out i aint trying to get arrested yet i just got here i sprang with the quickness like lightening disappeared 
 i whistled for a cab and when it came near the license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror if anything i can say is that this cab was rare 
 but i thought man forget it yo home to bel air i pulled up to the house about seven or eight and i yelled to the cabbie yo homes smell ya later i looked to my kingdom i was finally there to sit on my throne as the prince of bel air

 and they say that he got crazy once he tried to touch the sun and he lost a friend but kept his memory now he walks in quiet solitude the forest and the streams seeking grace in every step he takes 
 his sight has turned inside himself to try understand the serenity of a clear blue mountain lake 
 and the colorado rocky mountain high ive seen it rainin fire in the sky talk to god listen to the casual reply 
 rocky mountain high colorado rocky mountain high colorado now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear of a simple thing he cannot comprehend 
 why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more 
 more people more scars upon the land

 give me reason to fill this hole connect the space between let it be enough to reach the truth that lies across this new divide 
 there was nothing in sight but memories left abandoned there was nowhere to hide the ashes fell like snow 
 and the ground caved in between where we were standing and your voice was all i heard that i get what i deserve 
 so give me reason to prove me wrong to wash this memory clean let the floods cross the distance in your eyes 
 across this new divide in every loss in every lie in every truth that youd deny and each regret and each goodbye was a mistake too great to hide and your voice was all i heard that i get what i deserve 
 so give me reason to prove me wrong to wash this memory clean let the floods cross the distance in your eyes

 singing ah la la la la de day ah la la la de day ah la la de day ooh ooh ooh she runs through the streets with eyes painted red under a black belly of cloudin the rain in through a doorway she brings me white gold and pearls stolen from the sea 
 she is raging she is raging and the storm blows up in her eyes she will suffer the needle chill shes running to stand still

 und die lieder singen weiter vom frieden auf der welt und der wind ist ihr begleiter 
 unterm weiten himmelszelt ja wir horen immer wieder und es klingt so wunderbar wenn die menschen sich nur lieben werden marchen einmal wahr one way wind one way wind
