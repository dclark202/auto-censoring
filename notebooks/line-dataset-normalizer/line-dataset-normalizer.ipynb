    "### Normalization consists of the following line-by-line process:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Remove all lines containing nan or non-English characters\n",
    "- For best results, this should happen after transcript is shortened to match with words\n",
    "- Small complication here: before subsequent cleaning, some words don't look like English. Chicken or the egg?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Collapse 3+ consecutive occurrences of same letter to 2 letters, e.g. moooooo -> moo (timestamps unchanged)\n",
    "- Some words, like hmm, moo, bzz need two consecutive letters\n",
    "- Most words, like fuuck, do not\n",
    "- So after reducing 3+ occurrences to 2, is a dictionary/wordfreq check good enough to say whether an additional letter should be deleted?\n",
    "- Most legit way to do this would be to check how such words are tokenized in Whisper model\n",
    "- woo, oh, no, ah, eyow, go, hm | hmm, \n",
    "- leave lalala alone\n",
    "- change yey to yay\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Check every word to see if it's a word\n",
    "- Might be better to use known dictionary on first pass to get dictionary-standard words before dealing with slang/spelling variants\n",
    "- Backup word test could be passes zipf_frequency test\n",
    "- If not, check if it should be combined with a nearby word fragment(s) to create an actual word, e.g. ci ty -> city. Or a double letter should be changed to a single letter, e.g. \"yees\" -> \"yes\"\n",
    "- Deal with misspellings by combining spell-checker and phonetics-checker\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### To-Do:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Combine word chunks and separate illegal compound words\n",
    "- Separated words work pretty good, but they're worsened by the absence of apostrophes like in \"we've\"\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Cut off transcripts at beginning and end if they don't match with words\n",
    "- This should also involve changing audio chunks; will need to write down new start and end times of each chunk\n",
    "- Shortening audio chunks should be automated (with quality/file type preserved)"
